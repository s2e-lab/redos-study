It would be much better to just fail these regexes, than for it to work most of the time but then if you give it just the right input it hangs.\nEdit to add: So there&#39;s stuff like this open source project that would maybe be something to look at if I decide I need to analyze any new regexes to make sure they aren&#39;t Evil.

If that doesn&#39;t,\nREMOVE THE BINARY because the program is badly behaved.\nAs a general principle we don&#39;t use Unix Railgun to trim the hedges.  https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#kill\nExplanation of above command:\n produces a list of process id&#39;s on the computer visible to this user.  The pipe grep filters that down for rows containing that string.  The  says don&#39;t match on the process itself doing the grepping.  The pipe awk print says split the rows on default delimiter whitespace and filter to the second column which is our process id.  The pipe xargs spins up a new process to send all those pid&#39;s to , ending them all.\nWhy  is bad, dangerous, ugly and hackish:\n\nThere&#39;s a small possibility that you will accidentally end the operating system or cause undefined behavior in an unrelated process, leading to whole system instability because  lists thousands of processes, and you can&#39;t be sure some 3rd party process shares your process name, or that in the time between read and execute kill -9, the processid had changed to something else, and now you&#39;ve ended some random necessary process unrelated to yours.\n\nIf the code being force-ended is doing any database ops or secure transactions with low probability race conditions, some fraction of a percent of the time, atomicity of that transaction will be wrecked, producing undefined behavior.  kill -9 takes no prisoners.  If your code is sensitive to this, try replacing the  part with a transmitted flag that requests a graceful shutdown, and only if that request is denied, last-resort to \n\n\nBut, if you understand all the risks and control for them with unique names, and you&#39;re ok with a few dropped transactions or occasional corruption, then 99.9% of the time yer gonna be fine. If there&#39;s a problem, reboot the computer, make sure there aren&#39;t any process collisions.  It&#39;s because of code like this that makes the tech support script: &quot;Have you tried restarting your computer&quot; a level 5 meme.  &quot;A Rogue Robot scraped  to find integers and sent those to , so reboot the computer to clear the problem.\nWhy not just use  which is easier?\nThe above gives me manual control because , , ,  and  are multi-platform standard.

            "body": "I know how terribly wrong it is to (attempt to) parse HTML with Regex, which is why I&#39;m trying really, really hard to avoid it.\n\nI have an app that generates HTML emails. We&#39;re using a big fancy WYSIWYG drop in email editor that takes care of generating responsive emails and also generates the abysmal markup for clients like MS Outlook. It does that last bit using conditional comments, which look something like the following. Note that the  has an  attribute, and wraps the  tag that non-mso clients will see.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one of dozens (possibly hundreds?) of possible formattings that we need to work with.\n\nPrior to the introduction of this editor, we asked our customers to generate their own HTML emails with a more rudimentary WYSIWYG HMTL editor; but it was incumbent on them to make responsive templates and test their content in various clients. From their perspective, this new editor is a huge win.\n\nAs we&#39;re sending emails, it&#39;s important to track the link clicks via a tracking link that redirects through to the originally-intended link.\n\nTo date, we&#39;ve used jSoup to parse the email content, looking for any anchor tags and replace their href attribute contents. Because regex html parsing is evil, right?\n\nConditional comments have thrown a wrench in those gears.\n\nBecause they are comments, jSoup ignores them, and clicks from MS Outlook and other clients that handle the  markup haven&#39;t been transformed to go through our link tracker, so the clicks don&#39;t get tracked. This is a problem for us.\n\n\n\nFirst idea: replace the conditional comments with a custom tag\n\nAt first I was hopeful to pre-process the message body before letting jSoup have it. I would replace  with  and  with . This was simple enough to do, even for complex forms of the conditions inside the comments. I used a regex to make some simple replacements:\n\n\n became \n became  \netc\n\n\nNotice that I url-encoded the original comment in its entirety. url-encoding it made sure that I could easily use regex to find my marker comments and transform them back (so that I didn&#39;t have to worry about  inside the &quot;orig&quot; attribute content...\n\nThis started to break down when I realized there were multiple possible ways the comments could be closed. I spent a little bit of time working on a similar approach for the closing tags.\n\n\n became \nsame approach for  and \n\n\nI don&#39;t know if you can have attributes on a closing tag. I never tested it because I had another realization before I got to that point. The realization was that using  wasn&#39;t going to produce desirable output from jSoup because the resulting INPUT would often look like:\n\n\n\nThis is not tidy HTML and jSoup will try to correct it, changing the order of tags to make something that it thinks is more correct. When I realized that, I stopped what I was doing and started thinking about the problem again.\n\n\n\nSecond idea: the same thing, but with comments\n\nIf the (new) problem was that jSoup didn&#39;t like my tag nesting, what if I could expose the HTML from inside the conditional comments as if it weren&#39;t commented out, but keep some markers in as comments that I can later transform back into comments? The goal was to aim at making this:\n\n\n\nThis should parse as fairly tidy HTML, right? So I made the code modifications and gave it a shot.\n\nSadly, the documents that we&#39;re working with are far more complex than the simple example I started from above. Here&#39;s the first few lines of an actual sample document:\n\n\n\nAfter the comment conversion, we&#39;ve effectively dropped an  block into the  block, of which jSoup is decidedly not a fan. This is what I get back for the above input, after converting the conditional comments into my plain marked comments, parsing with jSoup, and then converting my markers back to their conditional comments:\n\n\n\nThere are some big problems here. The  block gets basically immediately closed. The  tag moves up to before the  block, and everything that came after it moved down into the body. This isn&#39;t going to work.\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\nI feel like we&#39;re basically out of options. \n\n\nDo nothing and just don&#39;t count the clicks from MS Outlook/etc clients. In some cases we might be able to detect a click anyway via a downstream conversion on that email. (Even if we don&#39;t have record of you clicking the link, if you made a payment then we know you got there...)\nWe could let our mail provider do the link tracking for us (experimentation required; not positive they would track the  links either). Historically we started this system with a provider that didn&#39;t offer link tracking so we had to roll our own. Current provider offers it, but we&#39;ve got years of existing code and processes that would have to be updated to support this change. We&#39;re keeping it in our back pocket if we can&#39;t figure something else out, but the prospect of changing ships mid-stream is ... not appealing.\nOr lastly... maybe... regex? (/me ducks) We could let jSoup do its thing for the normal HTML, and then use regex to replace any links that remain. This becomes a game of whack-a-mole with current and future markup. What might we run into aside from a  in the future? &#175;\\_(ツ)_/&#175; And we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing without regular manual reviews.\n\n\nUnless there&#39;s another option that we haven&#39;t explored yet. So... are we stuck with nothing/regex?\n\nWe&#39;re on the JVM so anything Java is within reach, I guess.\n",

            "body": "The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Solution for Removing &quot;.html&quot; in NGINX:\nUPDATED ANSWER: This question piqued my curiosity, and I went on another, more in-depth search for a &quot;holy grail&quot; solution for  redirects in NGINX. Here is the link to the answer I found, since I didn&#39;t come up with it myself: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32966347/4175718\nHowever, I&#39;ll give an example and explain how it works. Here is the code:\n\nWhat&#39;s happening here is a pretty ingenious use of the  directive. NGINX runs a regex on the  portion of incoming requests. The regex checks if the URI has an .html extension and then stores the extension-less portion of the URI in the built-in variable .\nFrom the docs, since it took me a while to figure out where the  came from:\n\nRegular expressions can contain captures that are made available for later reuse in the $1..$9 variables.\n\nThe regex both checks for the existence of unwanted .html requests and effectively sanitizes the URI so that it does not include the extension. Then, using a simple  statement, the request is redirected to the sanitized URI that is now stored in .\nThe best part about this, as original author cnst explains, is that\n\nDue to the fact that $request_uri is always constant per request, and is not affected by other rewrites, it won&#39;t, in fact, form any infinite loops.\n\nUnlike the rewrites, which operate on any  request (including the invisible internal redirect to ), this solution only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.\nWhat does &quot;try_files&quot; do?\nYou will still need the  directive, as otherwise NGINX will have no idea what to do with the newly sanitized extension-less URIs. The  directive shown above will first try the new URL by itself, then try it with the &quot;.html&quot; extension, then try it as a directory name.\nThe NGINX docs also explain how the default  directive works. The default  directive is ordered differently than the example above so the explanation below does not perfectly line up:\n\nNGINX will first append  to the end of the URI and try to serve it. If it finds an appropriate  file, it will return that file and will maintain the extension-less URI. If it cannot find an appropriate  file, it will try the URI without any extension, then the URI as a directory, and then finally return a 404 error.\n\nUPDATE: What does the regex do?\nThe above answer touches on the use of regular expressions, but here is a more specific explanation for those who are still curious. The following regular expression (regex) is used:\n\nThis breaks down as:\n: indicates beginning of line.\n: match the character &quot;/&quot; literally. Forward slashes do NOT need to be escaped in NGINX.\n: capturing group: match any character an unlimited number of times\n: match the character &quot;.&quot; literally. This must be escaped with a backslash.\n: match the string &quot;html&quot; literally.\n: match a literal &quot;?&quot; or the end of the string. This is done to avoid mishandling file names with something after &quot;.html&quot;.\nThe capturing group  is what contains the non-&quot;.html&quot; portion of the URL. This can later be referenced with the variable . NGINX is then configured to re-try the request () and the  directive internally re-appends the &quot;.html&quot; extension so the file can be located.\nUPDATE: Retaining the query string\nTo retain query strings and arguments passed to a  page, the  statement can be changed to:\n\nThis should allow requests such as  to redirect to  instead of just .\n\nNote that this is considered safe usage of the `if` directive.\nFrom the NGINX page If Is Evil:\n\nThe only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:\nreturn ...;\nrewrite ... last;\n\n\nAlso, note that you may swap out the &#39;302&#39; redirect for a &#39;301&#39;.\nA  redirect is permanent, and is cached by web browsers and search engines. If your goal is to permanently remove the  extension from pages that are already indexed by a search engine, you will want to use a  redirect. However, if you are testing on a live site, it is best practice to start with a  and only move to a  when you are absolutely confident your configuration is working correctly.\n",

However, software engineers have added many extensions that take these implementations far beyond the formal definition. So, while most regular expression engines resemble one another, there is actually no standard. For this reason, a lot depends on what language, API, framework or library you are using.\n(Incidentally, to help reduce confusion, many have taken to using &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot; to describe these enhanced matching languages. See Is a Regex the Same as a Regular Expression? at RexEgg.com for more information.)\nThat said, most regex engines (actually, all of them, as far as I know) would accept . Most likely, there&#39;s an issue with escaping.\nThe Trouble with Escaping\nSome languages have built-in support for regexes, such as JavaScript. For those languages that don&#39;t, escaping can be a problem.\nThis is because you are basically coding in a language within a language. Java, for example, uses  as an escape character within it&#39;s strings, so if you want to place a literal backslash character within a string, you must escape it:\n\nHowever, regexes also use the  character for escaping, so if you want to match a literal  character, you must escape it for the regex engine, and then escape it again for Java:\n\nIn your case, you have probably not escaped the backslash character in the language you are programming in:\n\nAll this escaping can get very confusing. If the language you are working with supports raw strings, then you should use those to cut down on the number of backslashes, but not all languages do (most notably: Java). Fortunately, there&#39;s an alternative that will work some of the time:\n\nFor a regex engine,  and  mean exactly the same thing. Note that this doesn&#39;t work in every case, like newline (), open square bracket () and backslash ( or ).\nA Note about Matching Numbers\n(Hint: It&#39;s harder than you think)\nMatching a number is one of those things you&#39;d think is quite easy with regex, but it&#39;s actually pretty tricky. Let&#39;s take a look at your approach, piece by piece:\n\nMatch an optional  or \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\n\nMatch an optional \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\nFirst, we can clean up this expression a bit by using a character class shorthand for the digits (note that this is also susceptible to the escaping issue mentioned above):\n = \nI&#39;m going to use  below, but keep in mind that it means the same thing as . (Well, actually, in some engines  will match digits from all scripts, so it&#39;ll match more than  will, but that&#39;s probably not significant in your case.)\nNow, if you look at this carefully, you&#39;ll realize that every single part of your pattern is optional. This pattern can match a 0-length string; a string composed only of  or ; or, a string composed only of a . This is probably not what you&#39;ve intended.\nTo fix this, it&#39;s helpful to start by &quot;anchoring&quot; your regex with the bare-minimum required string, probably a single digit:\n\nNow we want to add the decimal part, but it doesn&#39;t go where you think it might:\n\nThis will still match values like . Worse, it&#39;s got a tinge of evil about it. The period is optional, meaning that you&#39;ve got two repeated classes side-by-side ( and ). This can actually be dangerous if used in just the wrong way, opening your system up to DoS attacks.\nTo fix this, rather than treating the period as optional, we need to treat it as required (to separate the repeated character classes) and instead make the entire decimal portion optional:\n\nThis is looking better now. We require a period between the first sequence of digits and the second, but there&#39;s a fatal flaw: we can&#39;t match  because a leading digit is now required.\nThis is actually pretty easy to fix. Instead of making the &quot;decimal&quot; portion of the number optional, we need to look at it as a sequence of characters: 1 or more numbers that may be prefixed by a  that may be prefixed by 0 or more numbers:\n\nNow we just add the sign:\n\nOf course, those slashes are pretty annoying in Java, so we can substitute in our long-form character classes:\n\nMatching versus Validating\nThis has come up in the comments a couple times, so I&#39;m adding an addendum on matching versus validating.\nThe goal of matching is to find some content within the input (the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;). The goal of validating is to ensure that the input is in an expected format.\nRegexes, by their nature, only match text. Given some input, they will either find some matching text or they will not. However, by &quot;snapping&quot; an expression to the beginning and ending of the input with anchor tags ( and ), we can ensure that no match is found unless the entire input matches the expression, effectively using regexes to validate.\nThe regex described above () will match one or more numbers within a target string. So given the input:\n\nThe regex will match , , ,  and .\nTo validate that a given input is a number and nothing but a number, &quot;snap&quot; the expression to the start and end of the input by wrapping it in anchor tags:\n\nThis will only find a match if the entire input is a floating point number, and will not find a match if the input contains additional characters. So, given the input , a match will be found, but given  no matches will be found.\nNote that some regex engines have a ,  or similar function, which essentially does what I&#39;ve described automatically, returning  if a match is found and  if no match is found. Also keep in mind that some engines allow you to set flags which change the definition of  and , matching the beginning/end of a line rather than the beginning/end of the entire input. This is typically not the default, but be on the lookout for these flags.\n",

            "body": "You can read this blog post that explains what most C# MIME parsers get wrong and why MimeKit can handle multiple charset encodings.\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/time-for-rant-on-mime-parsers.html\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-decoding-rfc2047-encoded-headers-is.html\nTime for a rant on mime parsers...\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\nWhere should I begin?\nI guess I should start by saying that I am obsessed with MIME and, in particular, MIME parsers. No, really. I am obsessed. Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ve written and/or worked on several MIME parsers at this point. It started off in my college days working on Spruce which had a horrendously bad MIME parser, and so as you read farther along in my rant about shitty MIME parsers, keep in mind: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve written a shitty MIME parser.\nAs a handful of people are aware, I&#39;ve recently started implementing a C# MIME parser called MimeKit. As I work on this, I&#39;ve been searching around on GitHub and Google to see what other MIME parsers exist out there to find out what sort of APIs they provide. I thought perhaps I&#39;ll find one that offers a well-designed API that will inspire me. Perhaps, by some miracle, I&#39;d find one that was actually pretty good that I could just contribute to instead of writing my own from scratch (yea, wishful thinking). Instead, all I have found are poorly designed and implemented MIME parsers, many probably belong on the front page of the Daily WTF.\nI guess I&#39;ll start with some softballs.\nFirst, there&#39;s the fact that every single one of them was written as  parsers. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ones claiming to be &quot;stream parsers&quot;, because all any of those did was to slap a  on top of the byte stream and start using . What&#39;s so bad about that, you ask? For those not familiar with MIME, I&#39;d like for you to take a look at the raw email sources in your inboxes particularly if you have correspondence with anyone outside of the US. Hopefully, most of your friends and colleagues are using more-or-less MIME compliant email clients, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find at least a few emails with raw 8bit text.\nNow, if the language they were using was C or C++, they might be able to get away with doing this because they&#39;d technically be operating on byte arrays, but with Java and C#, a &#39;string&#39; is a unicode string. Tell me: how does one get a unicode string from a raw byte array?\nBingo. You need to know the charset before you can convert those bytes into unicode characters.\nTo be fair, there&#39;s really no good way of handling raw 8bit text in message headers, but by using a  approach, you are really limiting the possibilities.\nNext up is the  approach. One of the 2 early parsers in GMime (pan-mime-parser.c back in the version 0.7 days) used a  approach, so I understand the thinking behind this. And really, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this approach as far as correctness goes, it&#39;s more of a &quot;this can never be fast&quot; complaint. Of the two early parsers in GMime, the pan-mime-parser.c backend was horribly slow compared to the in-memory parser. Of course, that&#39;s not very surprising. More surprising to me at the time was that when I wrote GMime&#39;s current generation of the parser (sometime between v0.7 and v1.0), it was just as fast as the in-memory parser ever was and only ever had up to 4k in a read buffer at any given time. My point is, there are far better approaches than  if you want your parser to be reasonably performant... and why wouldn&#39;t you want that? Your users definitely want that.\nOkay, now come the more serious problems that I encountered in nearly all of the mime parser libraries I found.\nI think that every single mime parser I&#39;ve found so far uses the &quot;String.Split()&quot; approach for parsing address headers and/or for parsing parameter lists on headers such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition.\nHere&#39;s an example from one C# MIME parser:\n\nHere&#39;s how this same parser decodes encoded-word tokens:\n\nWhat?! It completely throws away the charset in each of those encoded-word tokens. In the case of quoted-printable tokens, it assumes they are all ASCII (actually, latin1 may work as well?) and in the case of base64 encoded-word tokens, it assumes they are all in UTF-7!?!? Where in the world did he get that idea? I can&#39;t begin to imagine his code working on any base64 encoded-word tokens in the real world. &#129318;‍♂️\nI&#39;d just like to point out that this is what this project&#39;s description states:\nA small, efficient, and working mime parser library written in c#.\n...\nI&#39;ve used several open-source mime parsers before, but they all either\nfail on one kind of encoding or the other, or miss some crucial\ninformation. That&#39;s why I decided to finally have a go at the problem\nmyself.\nI&#39;ll grant you that his MIME parser is small, but I&#39;d have to take issue with the &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;working&quot; adjectives. With the heavy use of string allocations and regex matching, it could hardly be considered &quot;efficient&quot;. And as the code pointed out above illustrates, &quot;working&quot; is a bit of an overstatement.\nFolks... this is what you get when you opt for a &quot;lightweight&quot; MIME parser because you think that parsers like GMime are &quot;bloated&quot;.\nOn to parser #2... I like to call this the &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; approach:\n\nI&#39;ll give this guy some credit, at least he saw that his  approach was flawed and so tried to compensate by piecing Humpty Dumpty back together again. Of course, with his String.Trim()ing, he just won&#39;t be able to put him back together again with any level of certainty. The white space in those quoted tokens may have significant meaning.\nMany of the C# MIME parsers out there like to use Regex all over the place. Here&#39;s a snippet from one parser that is entirely written in Regex (yea, have fun maintaining that...):\n\nLet&#39;s pretend that the regex pattern strings are correct in their definitions (because they are god-awful to read and I can&#39;t be bothered to double-check them), the replacing of &#39;_&#39; with a space is wrong (it should only be done in the &quot;q&quot; case) and the  is just evil. Not to mention that there could be multiple encoded words per field.Body which this code utterly fails to handle.\nGuys. I know you love regular expressions and that they are very very useful, but they are no substitute for writing a real tokenizer. This is especially true if you want to be lenient in what you accept (and in the case of MIME, you really need to be).\n",

            "body": "Why Are Evil Regexes A Problem?\nBecause computers do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it&#39;s not what you meant or is totally unreasonable. If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

If you have only a limited number of possible functions, the safest thing to do is to simply map them, and then separate the wanted function and the arguments in the variable, using an array instead. More on that later.\nIf you wanted to provide a generic means for calling functions, you could for example:\n\nI&#39;m using  here, since  is a language statement and not a function, and therefore wouldn&#39;t work like this. If you had to echo here, you&#39;d have to make your own echo wrapper function, like , and call that instead.\nOr, for more readable code, you could list the array as:\n\nIf you needed multiple arguments, you could use this structure:\n\nWhere the arguments listed in the arguments array, unpacked with the splat operator, are in the same order as the target function&#39;s arguments.\nThere are of course only a limited number of useful functions that will directly output anything. Therefore, in the above example we capture the result from  instead and then echo; this simply to illustrate the basic use of variable functions and arguments.\nThis approach will however provide unhinged access to any function in your system, and as such shouldn&#39;t be used on anything but data/calls from trusted sources (you). Allowing users to provide any commands will open up your system to a world of mischief and misery.\nTherefore, my initial recommendation of providing a map of functions. You could:\n\nHave an array with a list of allowed core functions,\nHave an array with a list of your custom wrapper functions, or\nCheck for valid wrapper functions named with a prefix\n\nYou could for example implement wrappers as follows:\n\nThis would give you control over what&#39;s executed, and also whether values are returned or output, etc. pre/post-process. And then iterate your variable commands as follows:\n\nFor an additional layer of insulation, create a class with your custom calls as its methods, instead of polluting the global space with more functions. Ciykd use a public router method that handles no-match cases; calling e.g. , where  returns the  methods.\nI often do something like this when I need to map user requests to class public methods that return output; named e.g. ,  etc. and  for a fallback for unmatched requests.

            "body": "PEP 585 -- Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections claims usability under both Python 3.7 and 3.8 with a standard  preamble. Notably:\n\nFor use cases restricted to type annotations, Python files with the  future-import (available since Python 3.7) can parameterize standard collections, including builtins.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, when  is used, function and variable annotations can parameterize standard collections directly. Example:\n\n\nWhile the above toy example does technically parse, that&#39;s about all it does. Attempting to actually use a parametrized builtin collection at runtime under either Python 3.7 or 3.8 invariably raises the dreaded  exception:\n\nNote the  statement is the standard idiom for resolving PEP 563-style postponed annotations at runtime. Don&#39;t even get me started on PEP 563.\nwho you gonna believe: me or your lying PEP?\nThis discourages the devout Pythonista in me. PEP 585 repeatedly claims that it preserves runtime usability:\n\nPreserving the generic type at runtime enables introspection of the type which can be used for API generation or runtime type checking. Such usage is already present in the wild.\n\n\nJust like with the  module today, the parameterized generic types listed in the previous section all preserve their type parameters at runtime:\n\n\nOf course, none of the above works under Python 3.7 or 3.8 – regardless of whether  is enabled or not:\n\nSo PEP 585 blatantly breaks the wild and all existing attempts to introspect generic types at runtime – especially from runtime type checkers. The entire &quot;Parameters to generics are available at runtime&quot; section is a charade.\nAm I missing something painfully obvious or are parametrized builtin collections the poison pill they superficially appear to be? Since evaluating these collections at runtime under Python 3.7 and 3.8 unconditionally raises exceptions, they&#39;re unusable at runtime – rendering them not simply useless but directly harmful for the widespread use case of type introspection and especially runtime type checking.\nbetween a rock and a hard PEP\nAny codebase type-hinting with parametrized builtin collections will be fundamentally incompatible with runtime type checkers under Python 3.7 and 3.8. Codebases preferring runtime to static type checking while preserving backward compatibility with Python &lt; 3.9 (which has yet to even be officially released as of this writing) thus have no choice but to avoid parametrized builtin collections entirely.\nExcept that too is infeasible. Why? Because PEP 585 deprecates the entire hierarchy of  pseudo-containers:\n\nImporting those [e.g., , , ] from  is deprecated. Due to PEP 563 and the intention to minimize the runtime impact of , this deprecation will not generate . Instead, type checkers may warn about such deprecated usage when the target version of the checked program is signalled to be Python 3.9 or newer. It&#39;s recommended to allow for those warnings to be silenced on a project-wide basis.\n\n\nThe deprecated functionality will be removed from the  module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0.\n\nConsider , for example. By 2025 (or shortly thereafter),  and thus  goes away. But  isn&#39;t safely parametrizable under Python 3.7 and 3.8, because doing so renders your project incompatible with anything that introspects types. So  isn&#39;t a viable option, either.\nSo there are no forward- and backward-compatible options. Instead, either:\n\nProhibit type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) entirely by just preferring builtin containers (e.g., ) to  pseudo-containers (e.g., ) or...\nSupport type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) by either:\n\nPreferring  pseudo-containers to builtin containers until 2025. At that time, both the project in question and all downstream projects of that project will need to be refactored as follows:\n\nDrop Python 3.7 and 3.8 support.\nReplace all  pseudo-containers with builtin containers.\n\n\nImmediately dropping Python 3.7 and 3.8 support by preferring builtin containers to  pseudo-containers. This has the distasteful disadvantage of requiring a currently unstable Python interpreter, but... that&#39;s technically an option. Somehow.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, there are no good options – only a spectrum of increasingly horrifying lessers of several malignant evils. One would hope that PEP authors would actually test their implementations at runtime. Yet, here we are, adrift without a paddle in a steaming cesspit of theorycrafted anti-APIs. Welcome to Python.\nbut that&#39;s not all\nThere is technically a third way. It&#39;s even more distasteful – but it should technically work. One awful theorycrafting deserves another, I always say!\nSince PEP 563-driven postponed annotations are merely strings, type introspection could cleverly run a regex-based replacement on each type being introspected. For each type that is a postponed annotation, globally replace each substring referencing a parametrized builtin container (e.g., ) in that annotation string with the corresponding substring referencing a parametrized  pseudo-container (e.g., ).\nThe result? A Python 3.7- and 3.8-compatible postponed annotation string safely evaluatable until 2025, at which point that internal replacement (and Python 3.7 and 3.8 support) could just be quietly dropped.\nThat&#39;s a totally cray-cray ludicrous speed kludge for the stars, but... that would probably work. The core issue, of course, is that one shouldn&#39;t need insane hackery just to comply with core official PEPs. But there&#39;s an even deeper underlying cultural issue underneath that technical issue. No one – neither the author of PEP 585 nor any of the commentators reviewing PEP 585 – actually tested their new hypothetical proposed functionality before deprecating the existing well-tested functionality that actually worked.\nCore official PEPs should just work out of the box. Increasingly, they don&#39;t. And that should concern everyone.\n",

Probably a better solution is to compose these strings into a series of regexes.

I suspect that unless you&#39;re dealing with tens of thousands of rigs or unless performance is a critical aspect of this application, a naive O(n^2) solution would probably suffice.  (Remember that premature optimization is the root of all evil!)  A simple benchmark would bear this out.\n\nAn even-better solution -- and potentially faster -- would be to set up an elasticsearch instance, but once again that may be too much effort to go to when a naive approach would suffice in a fraction of the implementation time.\n",

If you omit line addresses (numeric, regular expressions, or a combination of both), then the entire file is processed.\n\nPoint 1:\n\nIf you only want to target the first line, then you should specify it explicitly.\n\n\n\nHowever, since you are trying to rid your files of &quot;evil&quot;, you probably want to remove &quot;evil&quot; anywhere (globally) it is found on the first line.\n\n\n\nPoint 2:\n\nThe &quot;evil&quot; you are dealing with uses non-alpha numeric characters, so you must be wary of using it as input in various contexts. In order to use a regular expression to search for regular expression meta-characters (?, +, *, [, ], ., et al), you must either:\n\n\nEscape the meta-characters with backslashes to avoid pattern\ncollisions (Example: ), or\nChange the regular expression pattern delimiter to avoid a pattern collision, or\nBoth (This is what you should do in this case).\n\n\nIn sed, you can change the regex pattern delimiter by escaping a character before your pattern begins.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nPoint 3:\n\nYou can search for strings as a  with regular expressions in sed! By definition, the most basic pattern is a sequence of characters. However, you must adhere to point number two above and escape any regex meta-characters, or the default pattern delimiter, /, if necessary.\n\nSolution 1:\n\nYour evil, I mean regex pattern, has regex meta-characters and the default pattern delimiter embedded in it!\n\n\n\nI would prescribe the following. Notice that I am now using double quotes because I want the shell to do variable interpolation before executing .

            "body": "Oh Yes You Can Use Regexes to Parse HTML!\nFor the task you are attempting, regexes are perfectly fine!\nIt is true that most people underestimate the difficulty of parsing HTML with regular expressions and therefore do so poorly.\nBut this is not some fundamental flaw related to computational theory. That silliness is parroted a lot around here, but don’t you believe them.\nSo while it certainly can be done (this posting serves as an existence proof of this incontrovertible fact), that doesn’t mean it&#160;should&#160;be.\nYou must decide for yourself whether you’re up to the task of writing what amounts to a dedicated, special-purpose HTML parser out of regexes. Most people are not.\nBut I am. ☻\n\nGeneral Regex-Based HTML Parsing Solutions\nFirst I’ll show how easy it is to parse arbitrary HTML with regexes. The full program’s at the end of this posting, but the heart of the parser is:\n\nSee how easy that is to read?\nAs written, it identifies each piece of HTML and tells  where it found that piece. You could easily modify it to do whatever else you want with any given type of piece, or for more particular types than these.\nI have no failing test cases (left :): I’ve successfully run this code on more than 100,000 HTML files — every single one I could quickly and easily get my hands on. Beyond those, I’ve also run it on files specifically constructed to break na&#239;ve parsers.\nThis is not a na&#239;ve parser.\nOh, I’m sure it isn’t perfect, but I haven’t managed to break it yet.  I figure that even if something did, the fix would be easy to fit in because of the program’s clear structure. Even regex-heavy programs should have stucture.\nNow that that’s out of the way, let me address the OP’s question.\nDemo of Solving the OP’s Task Using Regexes\nThe little  program I include below produces the following output, so that you can see that parsing HTML with regexes works just fine for what you wish to do:\n\nParse Input Tags, See No Evil Input\nHere’s the source for the program that produced the output above.\n\nThere you go! Nothing to it! :)\nOnly  you can judge whether your skill with regexes is up to any particular parsing task. Everyone’s level of skill is different, and every new task is different. For jobs where you have a well-defined input set, regexes are obviously the right choice, because it is trivial to put some together when you have a restricted subset of HTML to deal with. Even regex beginners should be handle those jobs with regexes.  Anything else is overkill.\nHowever, once the HTML starts becoming less nailed down, once it starts to ramify in ways you cannot predict but which are perfectly legal, once you have to match more different sorts of things or with more complex dependencies, you will eventually reach a point where you have to work harder to effect a solution that uses regexes than you would have to using a parsing class. Where that break-even point falls  depends again on your own comfort level with regexes.\nSo What Should I Do?\nI’m not going to tell you what you must do or what you cannot do.  I think that’s Wrong. I just want to present you with possibilties, open your eyes a bit. You get to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. There are no absolutes — and nobody else knows your own situation as well as you yourself do. If something seems like it’s too much work, well, maybe it is.  Programming should be fun, you know. If it isn’t, you may be doing it wrong.\nOne can look at my  program in any number of valid ways.  One such is that you indeed can parse HTML with regular expressions. But another is that it is much, much, much harder than almost anyone ever thinks it is. This can easily lead to the conclusion that my program is a testament to what you should not do, because it really is too hard.\nI won’t disagree with that.  Certainly if everything I do in my program doesn’t make sense to you after some study, then you should not be attempting to use regexes for this kind of task. For specific HTML, regexes are great, but for generic HTML, they’re tantamount to madness. I use parsing classes all the time, especially if it’s HTML I haven’t generated myself.\nRegexes  optimal for small HTML parsing problems,  pessimal for large ones\nEven if my program is taken as  illustrative of why you should not use regexes for parsing general HTML — which is OK, because I kinda meant for it to be that ☺  — it still should be an eye-opener so more people break the terribly common and nasty, nasty habit of writing unreadable, unstructured, and unmaintainable patterns.\nPatterns do not have to be ugly, and they do not have to be hard. If you create ugly patterns, it is a reflection on you, not them.\nPhenomenally Exquisite Regex Language\nI’ve been asked to point out that my proferred solution to your problem has been written in Perl. Are you surprised? Did you not notice? Is this revelation a bombshell?\nIt is true that not all other tools and programming languages are quite as convenient, expressive, and powerful when it comes to regexes as Perl is. There’s a big spectrum out there, with some being more suitable than others.  In general, the languages that have expressed regexes as part of the core language instead of as a library are easier to work with. I’ve done nothing with regexes that you couldn’t do in, say, PCRE, although you would structure the program differently if you were using C.\nEventually other languages will be catch up with where Perl is now in terms of regexes.  I say this because back when Perl started, nobody else had anything like Perl’s regexes. Say anything you like, but this is where Perl clearly won: everybody copied Perl’s regexes albeit at varying stages of their development.  Perl pioneered almost (not quite all, but almost) everything that you have come to rely on in modern patterns today, no matter what tool or language you use.  So eventually the others will catch up.\nBut they’ll only catch up to where Perl was sometime in the past, just as it is now.  Everything advances.  In regexes if nothing else, where Perl leads, others follow. Where will Perl be once everybody else finally catches up to where Perl is now?  I have no idea, but I know we too will have moved. Probably we’ll be closer to Perl₆’s style of crafting patterns.\nIf you like that kind  of thing but would like to use it in Perl₅,  you might be interested in Damian Conway’s wonderful Regexp::Grammars module. It’s completely awesome, and makes what I’ve done here in my program seem just as primitive as mine makes the patterns that people cram together without whitespace or alphabetic identifiers.  Check it out!\n\nSimple HTML Chunker\nHere is the complete source to the parser I showed the centerpiece from at the beginning of this posting.\nI am not suggesting that you should use this over a rigorously tested parsing class. But I am tired of people pretending that nobody can parse HTML with regexes just because they can’t. You clearly can, and this program is proof of that assertion.\nSure,  it isn’t easy, but it is possible!\nAnd trying to do so is a terrible waste of time, because good parsing classes exist which you should use for this task.  The right answer to people trying to parse arbitrary HTML is not that it is impossible.  That is a facile and disingenuous answer.  The correct and honest answer is that they shouldn’t attempt it because it is too much of a bother to figure out from scratch; they should not  break their back striving to re&#239;nvent a wheel that works perfectly well.\nOn the other hand, HTML that falls within a predicable subset is ultra-easy to parse with regexes. It’s no wonder people try to use them, because for small problems, toy problems perhaps, nothing could be easier. That’s why it’s so important to distinguish the two tasks — specific vs generic — as these do not necessarily demand the same approach.\nI hope in the future here to see a more fair and honest treatment of questions about HTML and regexes.\nHere’s my HTML lexer.  It doesn’t try to do a validating parse; it just identifies the lexical elements. You might think of it more as an HTML chunker than an HTML parser. It isn’t very forgiving of broken HTML, although it makes some very small allowances in that direction.\nEven if you never parse full HTML yourself (and why should you? it’s a solved problem!), this program has lots of cool regex bits that I believe a lot of people can learn a lot from.

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nYou may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\nFinally, many PHP frameworks including Symfony, Zend and Laravel (there is no mention of this in the coding guidelines but it follows the suit) and the PSR-2 standard (item 2.2) require omission of the closing tag. PHP manual itself (1,2), Wordpress, Drupal and many other PHP software I guess, advise to do so. If you simply make a habit of following the standard (and setup PHP-CS-Fixer for your code) you can forget the issue. Otherwise you will always need to keep the issue in your mind.\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after . An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code. Bonus in bonus: A regex for deleting needless PHP endings: replace  with empty text in all files that contain PHP code.\n\n",

            "body": "There doesn&#39;t seem to be a great answer for this, after trying many things.\nIf there is an answer to the question it might be that there&#39;s no good way to do it. I think it doesn&#39;t hurt to look at potential solutions though and the drawbacks of each one.\n\nSolution 1\n\nUse componentWillUpdate. This is deprecated.\n\nSolution 2\n\nValidate state on render - but in your case and in most others, validation may lead to setState, which react tells you never to do in render(), but doesn&#39;t go into any detail about what will actually happen. Of course, you would have to be careful to prevent infinite loops, but if you call setState in render() upon some condition which cannot logically result in an infinite loop, then what unintended side effects could occur? \n\nSolution 3\n\nAs above, make a wrapper function to both validate and set state. But this is no good in my opinion because any state changes done with set state directly cannot be validated. Not only does setState directly not call your validation, but your validation also does not run on the items in the initial state. You might say, why would you give your component an initial state that&#39;s invalid, but I don&#39;t care, if I want to validate state I want it to validate 50000% of the time and no less.\n\nIn a complex form example, there are other issues with this. What if the validity of one field depends on the state of another field? Surely then, a function to re-validate a field when it changes is not enough. Some people will say to test the field being passed in and dispatch multiple events for re-validation, but again, this just isn&#39;t acceptable to me. Its not fullproof, it can lead to bugs, and make things hard to test. \n\nSolution 4\n\nUse componentWillReceiveProps. Not only is this deprecated, but its also static, meaning that you don&#39;t have access to the component instance. For some components this is fine because you can still modify the state that is returned, but if your component has data outside of state and props then you cannot access it, in addition to not being able to use non-static methods, which in my opinion makes this method pretty useless in many situations.\n\nSolution 5\n\nHaven&#39;t tested this one (bear with me, its fairly nuts), but you can override setState function in your component. Insert a callback into every setState instance. Track how many times setState is called and how many times the setState callback is called. Inside the callback, you can check the two counters stored in the object to see if the last callback is currently running, then, if it is, run one function which validates all state. On render, set both of the counters back down to zero. I don&#39;t recommend this by any means. It may work but its a pretty major hack.\n\nSolution 6\n\nYou can use componentDidUpdate, but this is inefficient. You will be blindly setting state with a value that was not validated then letting your component render only to validate it after and possibly call render again. Once again you have to be careful to avoid infinite loop while calling setState in componentDidUpdate. I read elsewhere that at least if you set the state here, the DOM will only re-draw once. In other words, it doesn&#39;t draw immediately after render() but waits until componentDidUpdate is triggered and re-calls render if state changes in there. This seems like maybe its the only solution I know about that react only warns about without telling you explicitely not to do this. In your case, the efficiency does not matter, but what if the state you were trying to validate was a 100 field form with a very expensive render method. Now, on every key down you&#39;ve essentially doubled the amount of work that react has to do to render your components, causing them to first render without being validated, and then filtering and/or validating them for a very likely second render.\n\nAdditional Issues\n\nIn my case, i&#39;m working on a form and not a simple component like you described above. I may go with a mix of solution 3 and 5. Its more complicated then I want though. It involves using one function to filter, generate errors, and set the state for each field (ie. solution 3). And then on componenetDidUpdate I may look for state keys whose values are different from the last value that the field was validated with. The second step here has many ways of doing so, all of which are messy and inefficient. To make it worse, they practically never run under normal circumstances because I always use the first function to update and validate their state, so this makes testing it harder. It&#39;s like leaving some fallback in my app that seems to work but during the entire development process it never triggers except for like the one time that I decided to test it. Seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nThere are additional efficiency concerns I also won&#39;t get into which relates to trying not to re-validate a field if it has the same value it was validated with last time. This is a whole other can of worms, but basically what it boils down to is that you should be able to not only validate a state before render, but you should have access to the previous state as well, so you can save some cpu time and only validate the fields that changed. For example, if you have a very long textarea with some complex regex, it would be nice to not validate that on every component render even if its a separate field that is changing.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nI&#39;m very thoroughly disappointed that react seems to provide no legitimate option for this. Seeing as you can call setState many times in one operation, and each one will be queued, how is it that they don&#39;t provide us with one callback after all state changes are resolved and we&#39;re about to render? Well if you think about it, the render function itself is this callback, because I think its only ever called after setStates are resolved, but again, its evil to call setState on render, and it would be a million times cleaner to have render() simply receive the correct state, so I don&#39;t see how this is very useful.\n\nDoes anyone know why they decided to get rid of componentWillUpdate?\n",

Why risk that kind of isolation and &quot;rebuild&quot; a parser in your Node.js script? If your Node.js script breaks, your whole script will fail. In the worst case, you might even expose your machine to serious risks when you try to run untrusted code inside your main thread.\n\nInstead, try to do as much parsing as possible inside the context of the page. You can even do an evil  call there. There worst that could happen? Your browser hangs or crashes.\n\nExample\n\nImagine the following HTML page (very much simplified). You are trying to read the text which is pushed into an array. The only information you have is that there is an additional attribute  which is set to .\n\n\n\nBad code\n\nHere is a simple example what your code might look like right now:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the script extracts the JavaScript code from the page. Now we have the JavaScript code from the page and we &quot;only&quot; need to parse it, right? Well, this is the wrong approach. Don&#39;t try to rebuild a parser inside Node.js. Just use the browser. There are basically two approaches you can take to do that in your case.\n\n\nInject proxy functions into the page and fake some built-in functions (recommended)\nParse the data on the client-side (!) by using , a regex or  (eval only if really necessary)\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Inject proxy functions into the page\n\nIn this approach you are replacing native browser functions with your own &quot;fake functions&quot;. Example:\n\n\n\nThis code replaces the original  function with our own function. Everything works as normal, but when an item with our target id is pushed into an array, a special condition is triggered. To inject this function into the page, you could use . To receive the data from Node.js you would have to expose a function to the browser via :\n\n\n\nNow it doesn&#39;t really matter how complex the code of the page is, whether it happens inside some asynchronous handler or whether the page changes the surrounding code. As long as the target data is pushing the data into an array, we will get it.\n\nYou can use this approach for a lot of crawling. Check how the data is processed and replace the low level functions processing the data with your own proxy version of it.\n\nOption 2: Parse the data\n\nLet&#39;s assume the first approach does not work for some reason. The data is in some script tag, but you are not able to get it by using fake functions.\n\nThen you should parse the data, but not inside your Node.js environment. Do it inside the page context. You could run a regular expression or use . But do it before returning the data back to Node.js. This approach has the benefit that if your code will crash your environment for some reason, it will not be your main script, but just your browser that crashes.\n\nTo give some example code. Instead of running the code from the original &quot;bad code&quot; sample, we change it to this:\n\n\n\nThis will only return the parts of the code we need, which can then be fruther processed from within Node.js.\n\n\n\nIndependent of which approach you choose, both ways are much better and more secure than running unknown code inside your main thread. If you absolutely have to process the data in your Node.js environment, use a regular expression for it like shown in the answer from trincot. You should never use eval to run untrusted code.\n",

The official &quot;If is Evil&quot; page shows essentially the following as a good way to do things:\n\n\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to these various approaches.  One big advantage to a regex is that you can capture parts of the match and use them to modify the response.  Of course, you can usually achieve similar results with the other approaches by either setting a variable in the original block or using .  The downside of the regex approach is that it can get unwieldy if you want to match a variety of locations, plus the low precedence of a regex might just not fit with how you want to match locations —&#160;not to mention that  there are apparently performance impacts from regexes in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of including files (as far as I can tell) is that it is a little more flexible about exactly what you can include —&#160;it doesn&#39;t have to be a full location block, for example.  But it&#39;s also just subjectively a bit clunkier than named locations.\n\nAlso note that there is a related solution that you may be able to use in similar situations: nested locations.  The idea is that you would start with a very general location, apply some configuration common to several of the possible matches, and then have separate nested locations for the different types of paths that you want to match.

This runs in linear time, making complex patterns faster. It is located in the regexp package.\n\n\nRead more about the differences between backtracking and non-backtracking engines here.\n\n\n\nConsidering the glob library (according to that GitHub link) appears faster than Go&#39;s regexps, performance shouldn&#39;t be a problem.\n",

Basically, catastrophic backtracking happens when a regex fails to match and different permutations of the same regex can find a partial match.  The regex engine then tries all those permutations.  If you want to go over your code and inspect your regexes these are the 3 key issues to look at:\n\n\nAlternatives must be mutually exclusive.  If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails.  If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.  A classic example is  to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a &quot;dot matches line breaks&quot; mode.  If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces (matched by both  and ) will break the regex.  The fix is to use  to make the alternatives mutually exclusive or even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as  for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.\nQuantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive what comes between them.  Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match.  A classic example is  to match 3 things with &quot;anything&quot; between them. When  can&#39;t be matched the first  will expand character by character until the end of the line or file.  For each expansion the second  will expand character by character to match the remainder of the line or file.  The fix is to realize that you can&#39;t have &quot;anything&quot; between them.  The first run needs to stop at  and the second run needs to stop at .  With single characters  is an easy solution.  Since we now stop at the delimiter, we can use possessive quantifiers to further increase performance.\nA group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it.  That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.  This is the problem illustrated in JDB&#39;s answer.\n\n\nWhile I was writing my answer I decided that this merited a full article on my website.  This is now online too.\n",

They have a sweet point (mainly simple assignment or builtin operations). But if the actor is any kind of non-trivial you&#39;ll see the complexity ramp up quickly, not just for the human but also for the compiler. This leads to\n\n\nslow compilation\nsub-optimal emitted code\nharder to maintain source\nnew classes of error (e.g. when the expression templates hold references to locals/temporaries, something that Boost Proto (and hence Phoenix) does not prevent or signal. In fact, it encourages it by assuming all template expressions are ephemeral, but I digress).\n\n\n\n  Interestingly: Spirit X3 dropped Phoenix altogether, even though Phoenix was once the brain child of Spirit&#179;.\n  \n  The new style uses c++14 polymorphic lambdas, that look 90% like the helper function object in the original code, but inline as a lambda.\n\n\nThis specific case\n\nCan&#39;t work. At all.\n\nThe problem is that you&#39;re mixing lazy/deferred actors with direct invocations. That can never work. The type of  isn&#39;t supposed to be . Of course. It is supposed to be a lazy actor&#185; that can be used at some later time to create a . \n\nNow that we know that (and why)  is an actor type, it should become clear why it is completely bogus to call  on it. You might as well say\n\n\n\nAnd wonder why it would not compile.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should probably just have the dedicated functor. You can of course Phoenix-adapt the regex functions you require, but all it does is shift the complexity tax for some syntactic sugar.\n\nI&#39;d always opt for the more naive approach that is going to be more understandable to a seasoned c++ programmer, and avoids pitfalls that come with high-wire acts&#178;.\n\nNevertheless, here&#39;s a pointer should you be curious:\n\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/phoenix/modules/function.html\n\nLive On Coliru\n\n\n\n\n\n&#185; think composed function object that can be invoked at a later time\n\n&#178; the balance might tip if you were designing this as an EDSL for further configuration by non-experts, but then you will have the added responsibility of documenting your EDSL and the constraints in which it can be used\n\n&#179; should we say, spirit-child of a brain?\n",

If that doesn&#39;t,\nREMOVE THE BINARY because the program is badly behaved.\nAs a general principle we don&#39;t use Unix Railgun to trim the hedges.  https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#kill\nExplanation of above command:\n produces a list of process id&#39;s on the computer visible to this user.  The pipe grep filters that down for rows containing that string.  The  says don&#39;t match on the process itself doing the grepping.  The pipe awk print says split the rows on default delimiter whitespace and filter to the second column which is our process id.  The pipe xargs spins up a new process to send all those pid&#39;s to , ending them all.\nWhy  is bad, dangerous, ugly and hackish:\n\nThere&#39;s a small possibility that you will accidentally end the operating system or cause undefined behavior in an unrelated process, leading to whole system instability because  lists thousands of processes, and you can&#39;t be sure some 3rd party process shares your process name, or that in the time between read and execute kill -9, the processid had changed to something else, and now you&#39;ve ended some random necessary process unrelated to yours.\n\nIf the code being force-ended is doing any database ops or secure transactions with low probability race conditions, some fraction of a percent of the time, atomicity of that transaction will be wrecked, producing undefined behavior.  kill -9 takes no prisoners.  If your code is sensitive to this, try replacing the  part with a transmitted flag that requests a graceful shutdown, and only if that request is denied, last-resort to \n\n\nBut, if you understand all the risks and control for them with unique names, and you&#39;re ok with a few dropped transactions or occasional corruption, then 99.9% of the time yer gonna be fine. If there&#39;s a problem, reboot the computer, make sure there aren&#39;t any process collisions.  It&#39;s because of code like this that makes the tech support script: &quot;Have you tried restarting your computer&quot; a level 5 meme.  &quot;A Rogue Robot scraped  to find integers and sent those to , so reboot the computer to clear the problem.\nWhy not just use  which is easier?\nThe above gives me manual control because , , ,  and  are multi-platform standard.

            "body": "I know how terribly wrong it is to (attempt to) parse HTML with Regex, which is why I&#39;m trying really, really hard to avoid it.\n\nI have an app that generates HTML emails. We&#39;re using a big fancy WYSIWYG drop in email editor that takes care of generating responsive emails and also generates the abysmal markup for clients like MS Outlook. It does that last bit using conditional comments, which look something like the following. Note that the  has an  attribute, and wraps the  tag that non-mso clients will see.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one of dozens (possibly hundreds?) of possible formattings that we need to work with.\n\nPrior to the introduction of this editor, we asked our customers to generate their own HTML emails with a more rudimentary WYSIWYG HMTL editor; but it was incumbent on them to make responsive templates and test their content in various clients. From their perspective, this new editor is a huge win.\n\nAs we&#39;re sending emails, it&#39;s important to track the link clicks via a tracking link that redirects through to the originally-intended link.\n\nTo date, we&#39;ve used jSoup to parse the email content, looking for any anchor tags and replace their href attribute contents. Because regex html parsing is evil, right?\n\nConditional comments have thrown a wrench in those gears.\n\nBecause they are comments, jSoup ignores them, and clicks from MS Outlook and other clients that handle the  markup haven&#39;t been transformed to go through our link tracker, so the clicks don&#39;t get tracked. This is a problem for us.\n\n\n\nFirst idea: replace the conditional comments with a custom tag\n\nAt first I was hopeful to pre-process the message body before letting jSoup have it. I would replace  with  and  with . This was simple enough to do, even for complex forms of the conditions inside the comments. I used a regex to make some simple replacements:\n\n\n became \n became  \netc\n\n\nNotice that I url-encoded the original comment in its entirety. url-encoding it made sure that I could easily use regex to find my marker comments and transform them back (so that I didn&#39;t have to worry about  inside the &quot;orig&quot; attribute content...\n\nThis started to break down when I realized there were multiple possible ways the comments could be closed. I spent a little bit of time working on a similar approach for the closing tags.\n\n\n became \nsame approach for  and \n\n\nI don&#39;t know if you can have attributes on a closing tag. I never tested it because I had another realization before I got to that point. The realization was that using  wasn&#39;t going to produce desirable output from jSoup because the resulting INPUT would often look like:\n\n\n\nThis is not tidy HTML and jSoup will try to correct it, changing the order of tags to make something that it thinks is more correct. When I realized that, I stopped what I was doing and started thinking about the problem again.\n\n\n\nSecond idea: the same thing, but with comments\n\nIf the (new) problem was that jSoup didn&#39;t like my tag nesting, what if I could expose the HTML from inside the conditional comments as if it weren&#39;t commented out, but keep some markers in as comments that I can later transform back into comments? The goal was to aim at making this:\n\n\n\nThis should parse as fairly tidy HTML, right? So I made the code modifications and gave it a shot.\n\nSadly, the documents that we&#39;re working with are far more complex than the simple example I started from above. Here&#39;s the first few lines of an actual sample document:\n\n\n\nAfter the comment conversion, we&#39;ve effectively dropped an  block into the  block, of which jSoup is decidedly not a fan. This is what I get back for the above input, after converting the conditional comments into my plain marked comments, parsing with jSoup, and then converting my markers back to their conditional comments:\n\n\n\nThere are some big problems here. The  block gets basically immediately closed. The  tag moves up to before the  block, and everything that came after it moved down into the body. This isn&#39;t going to work.\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\nI feel like we&#39;re basically out of options. \n\n\nDo nothing and just don&#39;t count the clicks from MS Outlook/etc clients. In some cases we might be able to detect a click anyway via a downstream conversion on that email. (Even if we don&#39;t have record of you clicking the link, if you made a payment then we know you got there...)\nWe could let our mail provider do the link tracking for us (experimentation required; not positive they would track the  links either). Historically we started this system with a provider that didn&#39;t offer link tracking so we had to roll our own. Current provider offers it, but we&#39;ve got years of existing code and processes that would have to be updated to support this change. We&#39;re keeping it in our back pocket if we can&#39;t figure something else out, but the prospect of changing ships mid-stream is ... not appealing.\nOr lastly... maybe... regex? (/me ducks) We could let jSoup do its thing for the normal HTML, and then use regex to replace any links that remain. This becomes a game of whack-a-mole with current and future markup. What might we run into aside from a  in the future? &#175;\\_(ツ)_/&#175; And we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing without regular manual reviews.\n\n\nUnless there&#39;s another option that we haven&#39;t explored yet. So... are we stuck with nothing/regex?\n\nWe&#39;re on the JVM so anything Java is within reach, I guess.\n",

I even want to apply source filters (gasp!) if it helps. \n\nBut this question also suggests that I might want to be a good citizen of Perl as well, because I only to break the community guidelines in certain cases. It is quite awesome to be able to create major business-level actions just by changing the command line in a batch scheduler rather than writing a whole new module. The test cycle is much compressed. \n",

            "body": "The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Solution for Removing &quot;.html&quot; in NGINX:\nUPDATED ANSWER: This question piqued my curiosity, and I went on another, more in-depth search for a &quot;holy grail&quot; solution for  redirects in NGINX. Here is the link to the answer I found, since I didn&#39;t come up with it myself: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32966347/4175718\nHowever, I&#39;ll give an example and explain how it works. Here is the code:\n\nWhat&#39;s happening here is a pretty ingenious use of the  directive. NGINX runs a regex on the  portion of incoming requests. The regex checks if the URI has an .html extension and then stores the extension-less portion of the URI in the built-in variable .\nFrom the docs, since it took me a while to figure out where the  came from:\n\nRegular expressions can contain captures that are made available for later reuse in the $1..$9 variables.\n\nThe regex both checks for the existence of unwanted .html requests and effectively sanitizes the URI so that it does not include the extension. Then, using a simple  statement, the request is redirected to the sanitized URI that is now stored in .\nThe best part about this, as original author cnst explains, is that\n\nDue to the fact that $request_uri is always constant per request, and is not affected by other rewrites, it won&#39;t, in fact, form any infinite loops.\n\nUnlike the rewrites, which operate on any  request (including the invisible internal redirect to ), this solution only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.\nWhat does &quot;try_files&quot; do?\nYou will still need the  directive, as otherwise NGINX will have no idea what to do with the newly sanitized extension-less URIs. The  directive shown above will first try the new URL by itself, then try it with the &quot;.html&quot; extension, then try it as a directory name.\nThe NGINX docs also explain how the default  directive works. The default  directive is ordered differently than the example above so the explanation below does not perfectly line up:\n\nNGINX will first append  to the end of the URI and try to serve it. If it finds an appropriate  file, it will return that file and will maintain the extension-less URI. If it cannot find an appropriate  file, it will try the URI without any extension, then the URI as a directory, and then finally return a 404 error.\n\nUPDATE: What does the regex do?\nThe above answer touches on the use of regular expressions, but here is a more specific explanation for those who are still curious. The following regular expression (regex) is used:\n\nThis breaks down as:\n: indicates beginning of line.\n: match the character &quot;/&quot; literally. Forward slashes do NOT need to be escaped in NGINX.\n: capturing group: match any character an unlimited number of times\n: match the character &quot;.&quot; literally. This must be escaped with a backslash.\n: match the string &quot;html&quot; literally.\n: match a literal &quot;?&quot; or the end of the string. This is done to avoid mishandling file names with something after &quot;.html&quot;.\nThe capturing group  is what contains the non-&quot;.html&quot; portion of the URL. This can later be referenced with the variable . NGINX is then configured to re-try the request () and the  directive internally re-appends the &quot;.html&quot; extension so the file can be located.\nUPDATE: Retaining the query string\nTo retain query strings and arguments passed to a  page, the  statement can be changed to:\n\nThis should allow requests such as  to redirect to  instead of just .\n\nNote that this is considered safe usage of the `if` directive.\nFrom the NGINX page If Is Evil:\n\nThe only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:\nreturn ...;\nrewrite ... last;\n\n\nAlso, note that you may swap out the &#39;302&#39; redirect for a &#39;301&#39;.\nA  redirect is permanent, and is cached by web browsers and search engines. If your goal is to permanently remove the  extension from pages that are already indexed by a search engine, you will want to use a  redirect. However, if you are testing on a live site, it is best practice to start with a  and only move to a  when you are absolutely confident your configuration is working correctly.\n",

However, software engineers have added many extensions that take these implementations far beyond the formal definition. So, while most regular expression engines resemble one another, there is actually no standard. For this reason, a lot depends on what language, API, framework or library you are using.\n(Incidentally, to help reduce confusion, many have taken to using &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot; to describe these enhanced matching languages. See Is a Regex the Same as a Regular Expression? at RexEgg.com for more information.)\nThat said, most regex engines (actually, all of them, as far as I know) would accept . Most likely, there&#39;s an issue with escaping.\nThe Trouble with Escaping\nSome languages have built-in support for regexes, such as JavaScript. For those languages that don&#39;t, escaping can be a problem.\nThis is because you are basically coding in a language within a language. Java, for example, uses  as an escape character within it&#39;s strings, so if you want to place a literal backslash character within a string, you must escape it:\n\nHowever, regexes also use the  character for escaping, so if you want to match a literal  character, you must escape it for the regex engine, and then escape it again for Java:\n\nIn your case, you have probably not escaped the backslash character in the language you are programming in:\n\nAll this escaping can get very confusing. If the language you are working with supports raw strings, then you should use those to cut down on the number of backslashes, but not all languages do (most notably: Java). Fortunately, there&#39;s an alternative that will work some of the time:\n\nFor a regex engine,  and  mean exactly the same thing. Note that this doesn&#39;t work in every case, like newline (), open square bracket () and backslash ( or ).\nA Note about Matching Numbers\n(Hint: It&#39;s harder than you think)\nMatching a number is one of those things you&#39;d think is quite easy with regex, but it&#39;s actually pretty tricky. Let&#39;s take a look at your approach, piece by piece:\n\nMatch an optional  or \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\n\nMatch an optional \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\nFirst, we can clean up this expression a bit by using a character class shorthand for the digits (note that this is also susceptible to the escaping issue mentioned above):\n = \nI&#39;m going to use  below, but keep in mind that it means the same thing as . (Well, actually, in some engines  will match digits from all scripts, so it&#39;ll match more than  will, but that&#39;s probably not significant in your case.)\nNow, if you look at this carefully, you&#39;ll realize that every single part of your pattern is optional. This pattern can match a 0-length string; a string composed only of  or ; or, a string composed only of a . This is probably not what you&#39;ve intended.\nTo fix this, it&#39;s helpful to start by &quot;anchoring&quot; your regex with the bare-minimum required string, probably a single digit:\n\nNow we want to add the decimal part, but it doesn&#39;t go where you think it might:\n\nThis will still match values like . Worse, it&#39;s got a tinge of evil about it. The period is optional, meaning that you&#39;ve got two repeated classes side-by-side ( and ). This can actually be dangerous if used in just the wrong way, opening your system up to DoS attacks.\nTo fix this, rather than treating the period as optional, we need to treat it as required (to separate the repeated character classes) and instead make the entire decimal portion optional:\n\nThis is looking better now. We require a period between the first sequence of digits and the second, but there&#39;s a fatal flaw: we can&#39;t match  because a leading digit is now required.\nThis is actually pretty easy to fix. Instead of making the &quot;decimal&quot; portion of the number optional, we need to look at it as a sequence of characters: 1 or more numbers that may be prefixed by a  that may be prefixed by 0 or more numbers:\n\nNow we just add the sign:\n\nOf course, those slashes are pretty annoying in Java, so we can substitute in our long-form character classes:\n\nMatching versus Validating\nThis has come up in the comments a couple times, so I&#39;m adding an addendum on matching versus validating.\nThe goal of matching is to find some content within the input (the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;). The goal of validating is to ensure that the input is in an expected format.\nRegexes, by their nature, only match text. Given some input, they will either find some matching text or they will not. However, by &quot;snapping&quot; an expression to the beginning and ending of the input with anchor tags ( and ), we can ensure that no match is found unless the entire input matches the expression, effectively using regexes to validate.\nThe regex described above () will match one or more numbers within a target string. So given the input:\n\nThe regex will match , , ,  and .\nTo validate that a given input is a number and nothing but a number, &quot;snap&quot; the expression to the start and end of the input by wrapping it in anchor tags:\n\nThis will only find a match if the entire input is a floating point number, and will not find a match if the input contains additional characters. So, given the input , a match will be found, but given  no matches will be found.\nNote that some regex engines have a ,  or similar function, which essentially does what I&#39;ve described automatically, returning  if a match is found and  if no match is found. Also keep in mind that some engines allow you to set flags which change the definition of  and , matching the beginning/end of a line rather than the beginning/end of the entire input. This is typically not the default, but be on the lookout for these flags.\n",

            "body": "You can read this blog post that explains what most C# MIME parsers get wrong and why MimeKit can handle multiple charset encodings.\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/time-for-rant-on-mime-parsers.html\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-decoding-rfc2047-encoded-headers-is.html\nTime for a rant on mime parsers...\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\nWhere should I begin?\nI guess I should start by saying that I am obsessed with MIME and, in particular, MIME parsers. No, really. I am obsessed. Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ve written and/or worked on several MIME parsers at this point. It started off in my college days working on Spruce which had a horrendously bad MIME parser, and so as you read farther along in my rant about shitty MIME parsers, keep in mind: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve written a shitty MIME parser.\nAs a handful of people are aware, I&#39;ve recently started implementing a C# MIME parser called MimeKit. As I work on this, I&#39;ve been searching around on GitHub and Google to see what other MIME parsers exist out there to find out what sort of APIs they provide. I thought perhaps I&#39;ll find one that offers a well-designed API that will inspire me. Perhaps, by some miracle, I&#39;d find one that was actually pretty good that I could just contribute to instead of writing my own from scratch (yea, wishful thinking). Instead, all I have found are poorly designed and implemented MIME parsers, many probably belong on the front page of the Daily WTF.\nI guess I&#39;ll start with some softballs.\nFirst, there&#39;s the fact that every single one of them was written as  parsers. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ones claiming to be &quot;stream parsers&quot;, because all any of those did was to slap a  on top of the byte stream and start using . What&#39;s so bad about that, you ask? For those not familiar with MIME, I&#39;d like for you to take a look at the raw email sources in your inboxes particularly if you have correspondence with anyone outside of the US. Hopefully, most of your friends and colleagues are using more-or-less MIME compliant email clients, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find at least a few emails with raw 8bit text.\nNow, if the language they were using was C or C++, they might be able to get away with doing this because they&#39;d technically be operating on byte arrays, but with Java and C#, a &#39;string&#39; is a unicode string. Tell me: how does one get a unicode string from a raw byte array?\nBingo. You need to know the charset before you can convert those bytes into unicode characters.\nTo be fair, there&#39;s really no good way of handling raw 8bit text in message headers, but by using a  approach, you are really limiting the possibilities.\nNext up is the  approach. One of the 2 early parsers in GMime (pan-mime-parser.c back in the version 0.7 days) used a  approach, so I understand the thinking behind this. And really, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this approach as far as correctness goes, it&#39;s more of a &quot;this can never be fast&quot; complaint. Of the two early parsers in GMime, the pan-mime-parser.c backend was horribly slow compared to the in-memory parser. Of course, that&#39;s not very surprising. More surprising to me at the time was that when I wrote GMime&#39;s current generation of the parser (sometime between v0.7 and v1.0), it was just as fast as the in-memory parser ever was and only ever had up to 4k in a read buffer at any given time. My point is, there are far better approaches than  if you want your parser to be reasonably performant... and why wouldn&#39;t you want that? Your users definitely want that.\nOkay, now come the more serious problems that I encountered in nearly all of the mime parser libraries I found.\nI think that every single mime parser I&#39;ve found so far uses the &quot;String.Split()&quot; approach for parsing address headers and/or for parsing parameter lists on headers such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition.\nHere&#39;s an example from one C# MIME parser:\n\nHere&#39;s how this same parser decodes encoded-word tokens:\n\nWhat?! It completely throws away the charset in each of those encoded-word tokens. In the case of quoted-printable tokens, it assumes they are all ASCII (actually, latin1 may work as well?) and in the case of base64 encoded-word tokens, it assumes they are all in UTF-7!?!? Where in the world did he get that idea? I can&#39;t begin to imagine his code working on any base64 encoded-word tokens in the real world. &#129318;‍♂️\nI&#39;d just like to point out that this is what this project&#39;s description states:\nA small, efficient, and working mime parser library written in c#.\n...\nI&#39;ve used several open-source mime parsers before, but they all either\nfail on one kind of encoding or the other, or miss some crucial\ninformation. That&#39;s why I decided to finally have a go at the problem\nmyself.\nI&#39;ll grant you that his MIME parser is small, but I&#39;d have to take issue with the &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;working&quot; adjectives. With the heavy use of string allocations and regex matching, it could hardly be considered &quot;efficient&quot;. And as the code pointed out above illustrates, &quot;working&quot; is a bit of an overstatement.\nFolks... this is what you get when you opt for a &quot;lightweight&quot; MIME parser because you think that parsers like GMime are &quot;bloated&quot;.\nOn to parser #2... I like to call this the &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; approach:\n\nI&#39;ll give this guy some credit, at least he saw that his  approach was flawed and so tried to compensate by piecing Humpty Dumpty back together again. Of course, with his String.Trim()ing, he just won&#39;t be able to put him back together again with any level of certainty. The white space in those quoted tokens may have significant meaning.\nMany of the C# MIME parsers out there like to use Regex all over the place. Here&#39;s a snippet from one parser that is entirely written in Regex (yea, have fun maintaining that...):\n\nLet&#39;s pretend that the regex pattern strings are correct in their definitions (because they are god-awful to read and I can&#39;t be bothered to double-check them), the replacing of &#39;_&#39; with a space is wrong (it should only be done in the &quot;q&quot; case) and the  is just evil. Not to mention that there could be multiple encoded words per field.Body which this code utterly fails to handle.\nGuys. I know you love regular expressions and that they are very very useful, but they are no substitute for writing a real tokenizer. This is especially true if you want to be lenient in what you accept (and in the case of MIME, you really need to be).\n",

            "body": "Why Are Evil Regexes A Problem?\nBecause computers do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it&#39;s not what you meant or is totally unreasonable. If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

If you have only a limited number of possible functions, the safest thing to do is to simply map them, and then separate the wanted function and the arguments in the variable, using an array instead. More on that later.\nIf you wanted to provide a generic means for calling functions, you could for example:\n\nI&#39;m using  here, since  is a language statement and not a function, and therefore wouldn&#39;t work like this. If you had to echo here, you&#39;d have to make your own echo wrapper function, like , and call that instead.\nOr, for more readable code, you could list the array as:\n\nIf you needed multiple arguments, you could use this structure:\n\nWhere the arguments listed in the arguments array, unpacked with the splat operator, are in the same order as the target function&#39;s arguments.\nThere are of course only a limited number of useful functions that will directly output anything. Therefore, in the above example we capture the result from  instead and then echo; this simply to illustrate the basic use of variable functions and arguments.\nThis approach will however provide unhinged access to any function in your system, and as such shouldn&#39;t be used on anything but data/calls from trusted sources (you). Allowing users to provide any commands will open up your system to a world of mischief and misery.\nTherefore, my initial recommendation of providing a map of functions. You could:\n\nHave an array with a list of allowed core functions,\nHave an array with a list of your custom wrapper functions, or\nCheck for valid wrapper functions named with a prefix\n\nYou could for example implement wrappers as follows:\n\nThis would give you control over what&#39;s executed, and also whether values are returned or output, etc. pre/post-process. And then iterate your variable commands as follows:\n\nFor an additional layer of insulation, create a class with your custom calls as its methods, instead of polluting the global space with more functions. Ciykd use a public router method that handles no-match cases; calling e.g. , where  returns the  methods.\nI often do something like this when I need to map user requests to class public methods that return output; named e.g. ,  etc. and  for a fallback for unmatched requests.

            "body": "PEP 585 -- Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections claims usability under both Python 3.7 and 3.8 with a standard  preamble. Notably:\n\nFor use cases restricted to type annotations, Python files with the  future-import (available since Python 3.7) can parameterize standard collections, including builtins.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, when  is used, function and variable annotations can parameterize standard collections directly. Example:\n\n\nWhile the above toy example does technically parse, that&#39;s about all it does. Attempting to actually use a parametrized builtin collection at runtime under either Python 3.7 or 3.8 invariably raises the dreaded  exception:\n\nNote the  statement is the standard idiom for resolving PEP 563-style postponed annotations at runtime. Don&#39;t even get me started on PEP 563.\nwho you gonna believe: me or your lying PEP?\nThis discourages the devout Pythonista in me. PEP 585 repeatedly claims that it preserves runtime usability:\n\nPreserving the generic type at runtime enables introspection of the type which can be used for API generation or runtime type checking. Such usage is already present in the wild.\n\n\nJust like with the  module today, the parameterized generic types listed in the previous section all preserve their type parameters at runtime:\n\n\nOf course, none of the above works under Python 3.7 or 3.8 – regardless of whether  is enabled or not:\n\nSo PEP 585 blatantly breaks the wild and all existing attempts to introspect generic types at runtime – especially from runtime type checkers. The entire &quot;Parameters to generics are available at runtime&quot; section is a charade.\nAm I missing something painfully obvious or are parametrized builtin collections the poison pill they superficially appear to be? Since evaluating these collections at runtime under Python 3.7 and 3.8 unconditionally raises exceptions, they&#39;re unusable at runtime – rendering them not simply useless but directly harmful for the widespread use case of type introspection and especially runtime type checking.\nbetween a rock and a hard PEP\nAny codebase type-hinting with parametrized builtin collections will be fundamentally incompatible with runtime type checkers under Python 3.7 and 3.8. Codebases preferring runtime to static type checking while preserving backward compatibility with Python &lt; 3.9 (which has yet to even be officially released as of this writing) thus have no choice but to avoid parametrized builtin collections entirely.\nExcept that too is infeasible. Why? Because PEP 585 deprecates the entire hierarchy of  pseudo-containers:\n\nImporting those [e.g., , , ] from  is deprecated. Due to PEP 563 and the intention to minimize the runtime impact of , this deprecation will not generate . Instead, type checkers may warn about such deprecated usage when the target version of the checked program is signalled to be Python 3.9 or newer. It&#39;s recommended to allow for those warnings to be silenced on a project-wide basis.\n\n\nThe deprecated functionality will be removed from the  module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0.\n\nConsider , for example. By 2025 (or shortly thereafter),  and thus  goes away. But  isn&#39;t safely parametrizable under Python 3.7 and 3.8, because doing so renders your project incompatible with anything that introspects types. So  isn&#39;t a viable option, either.\nSo there are no forward- and backward-compatible options. Instead, either:\n\nProhibit type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) entirely by just preferring builtin containers (e.g., ) to  pseudo-containers (e.g., ) or...\nSupport type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) by either:\n\nPreferring  pseudo-containers to builtin containers until 2025. At that time, both the project in question and all downstream projects of that project will need to be refactored as follows:\n\nDrop Python 3.7 and 3.8 support.\nReplace all  pseudo-containers with builtin containers.\n\n\nImmediately dropping Python 3.7 and 3.8 support by preferring builtin containers to  pseudo-containers. This has the distasteful disadvantage of requiring a currently unstable Python interpreter, but... that&#39;s technically an option. Somehow.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, there are no good options – only a spectrum of increasingly horrifying lessers of several malignant evils. One would hope that PEP authors would actually test their implementations at runtime. Yet, here we are, adrift without a paddle in a steaming cesspit of theorycrafted anti-APIs. Welcome to Python.\nbut that&#39;s not all\nThere is technically a third way. It&#39;s even more distasteful – but it should technically work. One awful theorycrafting deserves another, I always say!\nSince PEP 563-driven postponed annotations are merely strings, type introspection could cleverly run a regex-based replacement on each type being introspected. For each type that is a postponed annotation, globally replace each substring referencing a parametrized builtin container (e.g., ) in that annotation string with the corresponding substring referencing a parametrized  pseudo-container (e.g., ).\nThe result? A Python 3.7- and 3.8-compatible postponed annotation string safely evaluatable until 2025, at which point that internal replacement (and Python 3.7 and 3.8 support) could just be quietly dropped.\nThat&#39;s a totally cray-cray ludicrous speed kludge for the stars, but... that would probably work. The core issue, of course, is that one shouldn&#39;t need insane hackery just to comply with core official PEPs. But there&#39;s an even deeper underlying cultural issue underneath that technical issue. No one – neither the author of PEP 585 nor any of the commentators reviewing PEP 585 – actually tested their new hypothetical proposed functionality before deprecating the existing well-tested functionality that actually worked.\nCore official PEPs should just work out of the box. Increasingly, they don&#39;t. And that should concern everyone.\n",

Because regexes are strings, it must be escaped: .\n\nFrom a lexical/syntactic standpoint it is true that  could be used unambiguously (as a bonus it would prevent the need for the &quot;evil escaped escape&quot; when using back references). \n\nTo match a  that comes after the end of a line the regex would need to be :\n\n\n\nIt just makes more sense to use a familiar syntax instead of changing the rules, most of which came from Perl.\n\nThe first version of Perl came out in 1987, which is much earlier than Java, which was released in beta in 1995. \n\nI dug up the man pages for Perl 1, which say:\n\n\n  The bracketing construct  may also be used, in which case  matches the &#39;th substring. (Outside of the pattern, always use  instead of  in front of the digit. The scope of  (and ,  and ) extends to the end of the enclosing BLOCK or eval string, or to the next pattern match with subexpressions. The  notation sometimes works outside the current pattern, but should not be relied upon.) You may have as many parentheses as you wish. If you have more than 9 substrings, the variables , , ... refer to the corresponding substring. Within the pattern, , , etc. refer back to substrings if there have been at least that many left parens before the backreference. Otherwise (for backward compatibilty)  is the same as , a backspace, and  the same as , a tab. And so on. ( through  are always backreferences.)\n\n",

In order to use a regular expression to search for regular expression meta-characters (?, +, *, [, ], ., et al), you must either:\n\n\nEscape the meta-characters with backslashes to avoid pattern\ncollisions (Example: ), or\nChange the regular expression pattern delimiter to avoid a pattern collision, or\nBoth (This is what you should do in this case).\n\n\nIn sed, you can change the regex pattern delimiter by escaping a character before your pattern begins.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nPoint 3:\n\nYou can search for strings as a  with regular expressions in sed! By definition, the most basic pattern is a sequence of characters. However, you must adhere to point number two above and escape any regex meta-characters, or the default pattern delimiter, /, if necessary.\n\nSolution 1:\n\nYour evil, I mean regex pattern, has regex meta-characters and the default pattern delimiter embedded in it!\n\n\n\nI would prescribe the following. Notice that I am now using double quotes because I want the shell to do variable interpolation before executing .

Most people are not.\nBut I am. ☻\n\nGeneral Regex-Based HTML Parsing Solutions\nFirst I’ll show how easy it is to parse arbitrary HTML with regexes. The full program’s at the end of this posting, but the heart of the parser is:\n\nSee how easy that is to read?\nAs written, it identifies each piece of HTML and tells  where it found that piece. You could easily modify it to do whatever else you want with any given type of piece, or for more particular types than these.\nI have no failing test cases (left :): I’ve successfully run this code on more than 100,000 HTML files — every single one I could quickly and easily get my hands on. Beyond those, I’ve also run it on files specifically constructed to break na&#239;ve parsers.\nThis is not a na&#239;ve parser.\nOh, I’m sure it isn’t perfect, but I haven’t managed to break it yet.  I figure that even if something did, the fix would be easy to fit in because of the program’s clear structure. Even regex-heavy programs should have stucture.\nNow that that’s out of the way, let me address the OP’s question.\nDemo of Solving the OP’s Task Using Regexes\nThe little  program I include below produces the following output, so that you can see that parsing HTML with regexes works just fine for what you wish to do:\n\nParse Input Tags, See No Evil Input\nHere’s the source for the program that produced the output above.\n\nThere you go! Nothing to it! :)\nOnly  you can judge whether your skill with regexes is up to any particular parsing task. Everyone’s level of skill is different, and every new task is different. For jobs where you have a well-defined input set, regexes are obviously the right choice, because it is trivial to put some together when you have a restricted subset of HTML to deal with. Even regex beginners should be handle those jobs with regexes.  Anything else is overkill.\nHowever, once the HTML starts becoming less nailed down, once it starts to ramify in ways you cannot predict but which are perfectly legal, once you have to match more different sorts of things or with more complex dependencies, you will eventually reach a point where you have to work harder to effect a solution that uses regexes than you would have to using a parsing class. Where that break-even point falls  depends again on your own comfort level with regexes.\nSo What Should I Do?\nI’m not going to tell you what you must do or what you cannot do.  I think that’s Wrong. I just want to present you with possibilties, open your eyes a bit. You get to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. There are no absolutes — and nobody else knows your own situation as well as you yourself do. If something seems like it’s too much work, well, maybe it is.  Programming should be fun, you know. If it isn’t, you may be doing it wrong.\nOne can look at my  program in any number of valid ways.  One such is that you indeed can parse HTML with regular expressions. But another is that it is much, much, much harder than almost anyone ever thinks it is. This can easily lead to the conclusion that my program is a testament to what you should not do, because it really is too hard.\nI won’t disagree with that.  Certainly if everything I do in my program doesn’t make sense to you after some study, then you should not be attempting to use regexes for this kind of task. For specific HTML, regexes are great, but for generic HTML, they’re tantamount to madness. I use parsing classes all the time, especially if it’s HTML I haven’t generated myself.\nRegexes  optimal for small HTML parsing problems,  pessimal for large ones\nEven if my program is taken as  illustrative of why you should not use regexes for parsing general HTML — which is OK, because I kinda meant for it to be that ☺  — it still should be an eye-opener so more people break the terribly common and nasty, nasty habit of writing unreadable, unstructured, and unmaintainable patterns.\nPatterns do not have to be ugly, and they do not have to be hard. If you create ugly patterns, it is a reflection on you, not them.\nPhenomenally Exquisite Regex Language\nI’ve been asked to point out that my proferred solution to your problem has been written in Perl. Are you surprised? Did you not notice? Is this revelation a bombshell?\nIt is true that not all other tools and programming languages are quite as convenient, expressive, and powerful when it comes to regexes as Perl is. There’s a big spectrum out there, with some being more suitable than others.  In general, the languages that have expressed regexes as part of the core language instead of as a library are easier to work with. I’ve done nothing with regexes that you couldn’t do in, say, PCRE, although you would structure the program differently if you were using C.\nEventually other languages will be catch up with where Perl is now in terms of regexes.  I say this because back when Perl started, nobody else had anything like Perl’s regexes. Say anything you like, but this is where Perl clearly won: everybody copied Perl’s regexes albeit at varying stages of their development.  Perl pioneered almost (not quite all, but almost) everything that you have come to rely on in modern patterns today, no matter what tool or language you use.  So eventually the others will catch up.\nBut they’ll only catch up to where Perl was sometime in the past, just as it is now.  Everything advances.  In regexes if nothing else, where Perl leads, others follow. Where will Perl be once everybody else finally catches up to where Perl is now?  I have no idea, but I know we too will have moved. Probably we’ll be closer to Perl₆’s style of crafting patterns.\nIf you like that kind  of thing but would like to use it in Perl₅,  you might be interested in Damian Conway’s wonderful Regexp::Grammars module. It’s completely awesome, and makes what I’ve done here in my program seem just as primitive as mine makes the patterns that people cram together without whitespace or alphabetic identifiers.  Check it out!\n\nSimple HTML Chunker\nHere is the complete source to the parser I showed the centerpiece from at the beginning of this posting.\nI am not suggesting that you should use this over a rigorously tested parsing class. But I am tired of people pretending that nobody can parse HTML with regexes just because they can’t. You clearly can, and this program is proof of that assertion.\nSure,  it isn’t easy, but it is possible!\nAnd trying to do so is a terrible waste of time, because good parsing classes exist which you should use for this task.  The right answer to people trying to parse arbitrary HTML is not that it is impossible.  That is a facile and disingenuous answer.  The correct and honest answer is that they shouldn’t attempt it because it is too much of a bother to figure out from scratch; they should not  break their back striving to re&#239;nvent a wheel that works perfectly well.\nOn the other hand, HTML that falls within a predicable subset is ultra-easy to parse with regexes. It’s no wonder people try to use them, because for small problems, toy problems perhaps, nothing could be easier. That’s why it’s so important to distinguish the two tasks — specific vs generic — as these do not necessarily demand the same approach.\nI hope in the future here to see a more fair and honest treatment of questions about HTML and regexes.\nHere’s my HTML lexer.  It doesn’t try to do a validating parse; it just identifies the lexical elements. You might think of it more as an HTML chunker than an HTML parser. It isn’t very forgiving of broken HTML, although it makes some very small allowances in that direction.\nEven if you never parse full HTML yourself (and why should you? it’s a solved problem!), this program has lots of cool regex bits that I believe a lot of people can learn a lot from.

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nYou may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\nFinally, many PHP frameworks including Symfony, Zend and Laravel (there is no mention of this in the coding guidelines but it follows the suit) and the PSR-2 standard (item 2.2) require omission of the closing tag. PHP manual itself (1,2), Wordpress, Drupal and many other PHP software I guess, advise to do so. If you simply make a habit of following the standard (and setup PHP-CS-Fixer for your code) you can forget the issue. Otherwise you will always need to keep the issue in your mind.\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after . An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

            "body": "There doesn&#39;t seem to be a great answer for this, after trying many things.\nIf there is an answer to the question it might be that there&#39;s no good way to do it. I think it doesn&#39;t hurt to look at potential solutions though and the drawbacks of each one.\n\nSolution 1\n\nUse componentWillUpdate. This is deprecated.\n\nSolution 2\n\nValidate state on render - but in your case and in most others, validation may lead to setState, which react tells you never to do in render(), but doesn&#39;t go into any detail about what will actually happen. Of course, you would have to be careful to prevent infinite loops, but if you call setState in render() upon some condition which cannot logically result in an infinite loop, then what unintended side effects could occur? \n\nSolution 3\n\nAs above, make a wrapper function to both validate and set state. But this is no good in my opinion because any state changes done with set state directly cannot be validated. Not only does setState directly not call your validation, but your validation also does not run on the items in the initial state. You might say, why would you give your component an initial state that&#39;s invalid, but I don&#39;t care, if I want to validate state I want it to validate 50000% of the time and no less.\n\nIn a complex form example, there are other issues with this. What if the validity of one field depends on the state of another field? Surely then, a function to re-validate a field when it changes is not enough. Some people will say to test the field being passed in and dispatch multiple events for re-validation, but again, this just isn&#39;t acceptable to me. Its not fullproof, it can lead to bugs, and make things hard to test. \n\nSolution 4\n\nUse componentWillReceiveProps. Not only is this deprecated, but its also static, meaning that you don&#39;t have access to the component instance. For some components this is fine because you can still modify the state that is returned, but if your component has data outside of state and props then you cannot access it, in addition to not being able to use non-static methods, which in my opinion makes this method pretty useless in many situations.\n\nSolution 5\n\nHaven&#39;t tested this one (bear with me, its fairly nuts), but you can override setState function in your component. Insert a callback into every setState instance. Track how many times setState is called and how many times the setState callback is called. Inside the callback, you can check the two counters stored in the object to see if the last callback is currently running, then, if it is, run one function which validates all state. On render, set both of the counters back down to zero. I don&#39;t recommend this by any means. It may work but its a pretty major hack.\n\nSolution 6\n\nYou can use componentDidUpdate, but this is inefficient. You will be blindly setting state with a value that was not validated then letting your component render only to validate it after and possibly call render again. Once again you have to be careful to avoid infinite loop while calling setState in componentDidUpdate. I read elsewhere that at least if you set the state here, the DOM will only re-draw once. In other words, it doesn&#39;t draw immediately after render() but waits until componentDidUpdate is triggered and re-calls render if state changes in there. This seems like maybe its the only solution I know about that react only warns about without telling you explicitely not to do this. In your case, the efficiency does not matter, but what if the state you were trying to validate was a 100 field form with a very expensive render method. Now, on every key down you&#39;ve essentially doubled the amount of work that react has to do to render your components, causing them to first render without being validated, and then filtering and/or validating them for a very likely second render.\n\nAdditional Issues\n\nIn my case, i&#39;m working on a form and not a simple component like you described above. I may go with a mix of solution 3 and 5. Its more complicated then I want though. It involves using one function to filter, generate errors, and set the state for each field (ie. solution 3). And then on componenetDidUpdate I may look for state keys whose values are different from the last value that the field was validated with. The second step here has many ways of doing so, all of which are messy and inefficient. To make it worse, they practically never run under normal circumstances because I always use the first function to update and validate their state, so this makes testing it harder. It&#39;s like leaving some fallback in my app that seems to work but during the entire development process it never triggers except for like the one time that I decided to test it. Seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nThere are additional efficiency concerns I also won&#39;t get into which relates to trying not to re-validate a field if it has the same value it was validated with last time. This is a whole other can of worms, but basically what it boils down to is that you should be able to not only validate a state before render, but you should have access to the previous state as well, so you can save some cpu time and only validate the fields that changed. For example, if you have a very long textarea with some complex regex, it would be nice to not validate that on every component render even if its a separate field that is changing.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nI&#39;m very thoroughly disappointed that react seems to provide no legitimate option for this. Seeing as you can call setState many times in one operation, and each one will be queued, how is it that they don&#39;t provide us with one callback after all state changes are resolved and we&#39;re about to render? Well if you think about it, the render function itself is this callback, because I think its only ever called after setStates are resolved, but again, its evil to call setState on render, and it would be a million times cleaner to have render() simply receive the correct state, so I don&#39;t see how this is very useful.\n\nDoes anyone know why they decided to get rid of componentWillUpdate?\n",

            "body": "Short answer: Don&#39;t (re)build a parser in Node.js, use the browser instead\n\nI strongly advise against evaluating or parsing crawled data in Node.js if you are anyway using puppeteer for crawling. When you are using puppeteer you already have a browser with a great sandbox for JavaScript code running in another process. Why risk that kind of isolation and &quot;rebuild&quot; a parser in your Node.js script? If your Node.js script breaks, your whole script will fail. In the worst case, you might even expose your machine to serious risks when you try to run untrusted code inside your main thread.\n\nInstead, try to do as much parsing as possible inside the context of the page. You can even do an evil  call there. There worst that could happen? Your browser hangs or crashes.\n\nExample\n\nImagine the following HTML page (very much simplified). You are trying to read the text which is pushed into an array. The only information you have is that there is an additional attribute  which is set to .\n\n\n\nBad code\n\nHere is a simple example what your code might look like right now:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the script extracts the JavaScript code from the page. Now we have the JavaScript code from the page and we &quot;only&quot; need to parse it, right? Well, this is the wrong approach. Don&#39;t try to rebuild a parser inside Node.js. Just use the browser. There are basically two approaches you can take to do that in your case.\n\n\nInject proxy functions into the page and fake some built-in functions (recommended)\nParse the data on the client-side (!) by using , a regex or  (eval only if really necessary)\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Inject proxy functions into the page\n\nIn this approach you are replacing native browser functions with your own &quot;fake functions&quot;. Example:\n\n\n\nThis code replaces the original  function with our own function. Everything works as normal, but when an item with our target id is pushed into an array, a special condition is triggered. To inject this function into the page, you could use . To receive the data from Node.js you would have to expose a function to the browser via :\n\n\n\nNow it doesn&#39;t really matter how complex the code of the page is, whether it happens inside some asynchronous handler or whether the page changes the surrounding code. As long as the target data is pushing the data into an array, we will get it.\n\nYou can use this approach for a lot of crawling. Check how the data is processed and replace the low level functions processing the data with your own proxy version of it.\n\nOption 2: Parse the data\n\nLet&#39;s assume the first approach does not work for some reason. The data is in some script tag, but you are not able to get it by using fake functions.\n\nThen you should parse the data, but not inside your Node.js environment. Do it inside the page context. You could run a regular expression or use . But do it before returning the data back to Node.js. This approach has the benefit that if your code will crash your environment for some reason, it will not be your main script, but just your browser that crashes.\n\nTo give some example code. Instead of running the code from the original &quot;bad code&quot; sample, we change it to this:\n\n\n\nThis will only return the parts of the code we need, which can then be fruther processed from within Node.js.\n\n\n\nIndependent of which approach you choose, both ways are much better and more secure than running unknown code inside your main thread. If you absolutely have to process the data in your Node.js environment, use a regular expression for it like shown in the answer from trincot. You should never use eval to run untrusted code.\n",

One big advantage to a regex is that you can capture parts of the match and use them to modify the response.  Of course, you can usually achieve similar results with the other approaches by either setting a variable in the original block or using .  The downside of the regex approach is that it can get unwieldy if you want to match a variety of locations, plus the low precedence of a regex might just not fit with how you want to match locations —&#160;not to mention that  there are apparently performance impacts from regexes in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of including files (as far as I can tell) is that it is a little more flexible about exactly what you can include —&#160;it doesn&#39;t have to be a full location block, for example.  But it&#39;s also just subjectively a bit clunkier than named locations.\n\nAlso note that there is a related solution that you may be able to use in similar situations: nested locations.  The idea is that you would start with a very general location, apply some configuration common to several of the possible matches, and then have separate nested locations for the different types of paths that you want to match.

Basically, catastrophic backtracking happens when a regex fails to match and different permutations of the same regex can find a partial match.  The regex engine then tries all those permutations.  If you want to go over your code and inspect your regexes these are the 3 key issues to look at:\n\n\nAlternatives must be mutually exclusive.  If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails.  If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.  A classic example is  to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a &quot;dot matches line breaks&quot; mode.  If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces (matched by both  and ) will break the regex.  The fix is to use  to make the alternatives mutually exclusive or even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as  for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.\nQuantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive what comes between them.  Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match.  A classic example is  to match 3 things with &quot;anything&quot; between them. When  can&#39;t be matched the first  will expand character by character until the end of the line or file.  For each expansion the second  will expand character by character to match the remainder of the line or file.  The fix is to realize that you can&#39;t have &quot;anything&quot; between them.  The first run needs to stop at  and the second run needs to stop at .  With single characters  is an easy solution.  Since we now stop at the delimiter, we can use possessive quantifiers to further increase performance.\nA group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it.  That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.  This is the problem illustrated in JDB&#39;s answer.\n\n\nWhile I was writing my answer I decided that this merited a full article on my website.  This is now online too.\n",

They have a sweet point (mainly simple assignment or builtin operations). But if the actor is any kind of non-trivial you&#39;ll see the complexity ramp up quickly, not just for the human but also for the compiler. This leads to\n\n\nslow compilation\nsub-optimal emitted code\nharder to maintain source\nnew classes of error (e.g. when the expression templates hold references to locals/temporaries, something that Boost Proto (and hence Phoenix) does not prevent or signal. In fact, it encourages it by assuming all template expressions are ephemeral, but I digress).\n\n\n\n  Interestingly: Spirit X3 dropped Phoenix altogether, even though Phoenix was once the brain child of Spirit&#179;.\n  \n  The new style uses c++14 polymorphic lambdas, that look 90% like the helper function object in the original code, but inline as a lambda.\n\n\nThis specific case\n\nCan&#39;t work. At all.\n\nThe problem is that you&#39;re mixing lazy/deferred actors with direct invocations. That can never work. The type of  isn&#39;t supposed to be . Of course. It is supposed to be a lazy actor&#185; that can be used at some later time to create a . \n\nNow that we know that (and why)  is an actor type, it should become clear why it is completely bogus to call  on it. You might as well say\n\n\n\nAnd wonder why it would not compile.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should probably just have the dedicated functor. You can of course Phoenix-adapt the regex functions you require, but all it does is shift the complexity tax for some syntactic sugar.\n\nI&#39;d always opt for the more naive approach that is going to be more understandable to a seasoned c++ programmer, and avoids pitfalls that come with high-wire acts&#178;.\n\nNevertheless, here&#39;s a pointer should you be curious:\n\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/phoenix/modules/function.html\n\nLive On Coliru\n\n\n\n\n\n&#185; think composed function object that can be invoked at a later time\n\n&#178; the balance might tip if you were designing this as an EDSL for further configuration by non-experts, but then you will have the added responsibility of documenting your EDSL and the constraints in which it can be used\n\n&#179; should we say, spirit-child of a brain?\n",

            "body": "The worst input for a regular expression will vary from engine to engine. The same regex and string may take no time at all on one engine, but never finish on another.\n\nDifferences between engines\n\nEngine Type\n\nFor certain engines, the &quot;evilest&quot; regex is still benign, running in linear time (or  time when both the length of the regex and the length of the string may vary.) Of course, the reason for this is the implementation. These engines don&#39;t backtrack; instead they use a finite state machine (FSM).\n\nNote that some backtracking implementations use FSM, but only as an intermediate step. Don&#39;t let this confuse you; they&#39;re not FSM.\n\nMost of the old regex engines (like sed) use FSM matching. There are a few new engines that use this implementation, such as Go. PCRE even has DFA functions (search for &quot;DFA&quot; here) that use this type of matching.\n\nAnother answer of mine also addresses the potential speed difference between the two implementations.\n\nIt would be wise to consider using a FSM implementation if you are really worried about malicious input affecting the speed of your regex. Unfortunately, FSM is not as powerful as the other implementation; it lacks support for some features, such as back references.\n\nOptimizations\n\nEvil is actually a bit subjective. Something evil to one regex engine may not be evil to a different engine. An evil plot can be thwarted if the engine is optimized. Optimizations are particularly important to backtracking engines, given their potential exponential run time.\n\nShort-circuiting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the engine may be able to quickly determine a match is impossible. While running the regex  against the string , Regex101 says:\n\n\n  Your match failed outright. What this means is the engine, due to its internal optimizations, understood that your pattern would never match at any position, and thus did not even attempt to.\n\n\nKeep in mind that Wikipedia says the regex is evil, especially when paired with that string.\n\nOf course, the engine is smart to not need to backtrack to determine the match wouldn&#39;t work. It saw something pretty obvious: the regex needs an  in order to match, but no  was present in the string.\n\nModifiers\n\nI mention this because you might not expect modifiers to be a factor in regex performance. But they are.\n\nEven PCRE, one of the more optimized implementations, may take considerably more steps with both the  and  modifiers enabled. See my question here for more information about this. In the end, I figured out that only certain characters trigger this behavior.\n\nAnalyzing Strings\n\nString length\n\nIn general, a long string will be slower than a short string. In fact, if you find a string of length x that causes catastrophic backtracking, you can make it backtrack a bit more by increasing the length of the string.\n\nGreedy vs. Lazy\n\nCompare the speeds of these regexes:\n\n\n  on \n on \n  on \n on \n\n\nEssentially, greedy matching is best when you think you will need to match a lot. Lazy matching is best when you need to match only a little.\n\nNote that if you change the regex to  or , then the engine may optimize things considerably.\n\nBrute force testing\n\nThere are several frameworks that are specifically designed to try to find vulnerabilities in your regexes. It may be worthwhile to try one out.\n\nThere&#39;s really one thing that I will suggest if you wanted to try making your own algorithm. It&#39;s not practical to try all characters in the dictionary, especially if you want to test long strings.\n\nInstead, look at your regex to determine what characters you should test. If you have  as your regex, there are really only two things that go into the match:  and not . You could really just imagine that there are only two characters:  and  (aka not ) when you generate your strings to brute force with.\n\nSetting timeouts\n\nIt would be fantastic to be able to ensure your regex finishes before the heat death of the universe, right? Some regex engines do have a way to set a time out.\n\n.NET:\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\n\n  \n  \n  Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it exists, the  value defined in the .\n  \n  When called,  restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script execution a call such as  is made, the script will run for a total of 45 seconds before timing out.\n\n\nPerl\n\nYou might as well visit the link, since it&#39;s right on Stack Overflow.\n",

Rather than failing the whole match, though, it will &quot;rewind the tape&quot; and start with the second alternative, matching &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; and then &quot;z&quot;... success!\n\nBacktracking with Quantifiers\n\nThis also works with quantifiers. A quantifier is anything that encourages the engine to match a repeating pattern, including , ,  and  (depending on the engine).\n\nA greedy quantifier (the default) will match as many repetitions as possible before moving on to the rest of the pattern. For example, given the pattern and input below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern  will begin by matching the entire string: &quot;foobar&quot;. However, when it moves on to the , the regex engine has reach the end of the input and the match fails. Rather than simply giving up, the engine will ask the last greedy quantifier to give up one of its repetitions, now matching &quot;fooba&quot;. The match still fails, so the engine asks  to give up the &quot;a&quot; (failure), and then the &quot;b&quot;. After giving up the &quot;b&quot;, the engine can now match , and the match succeeds.\n\nTrees and Backtracking\n\nAnother way of thinking of a regex is as a &quot;tree&quot;, and backtracking is going back up a node and trying another path. Given the pattern  and the input &quot;foobaz&quot;, the engine will attempt something like the following:\n\n\n\nCounting the &quot;Backtracks&quot;\n\nAs to why you see differences in the &quot;number&quot; of backtracks... this probably has a lot to do with internal optimizations and logging level. For example, RegexBuddy does not appear to be logging the match to the empty string before , while regex101 does. In the end, though, it doesn&#39;t really matter what exact order you backtrack in (what order you climb back up the tree) so long as you end up with the same result.\n\nEvil Regexes\n\nYou already know this, but for the benefit of anyone else who happens by, your regex was written to demonstrate &quot;catastrophic backtracking&quot; (aka &quot;evil regex&quot;), where the number of backtrack attempts grows exponentially as the length of the input increases. These regexes can be exploited to perform DoS attacks, so you must use caution not to introduce these into your patterns (as I found out).\n",

Regexes can however &quot;extract&quot; data. Extracting is what they&#39;re made for. The major drawback of regex HTML extraction over proper SGML toolkits or baseline XML parsers are their syntactic effort and varying reliability.\n\nConsider that making a somewhat dependable HTML extraction regex:\n\n\n\nis way less readable than a simple phpQuery or QueryPath equivalent:\n\n\n\nThere are however specific use cases where they can help.\n\n\nMany DOM traversal frontends don&#39;t reveal HTML comments , which however are sometimes the more useful anchors for extraction. In particular pseudo-HTML variations  or SGML residues are easy to tame with regexps.\nOftentimes regular expressions can save post-processing. However HTML entities often require manual caretaking.\nAnd lastly, for extremely simple tasks like extracting &lt;img src= urls, they are in fact a probable tool. The speed advantage over SGML/XML parsers mostly just comes to play for these very basic extraction procedures.\n\n\nIt&#39;s sometimes even advisable to pre-extract a snippet of HTML using regular expressions  and process the remainder using the simpler HTML parser frontends.\n\nNote: I actually have this app, where I employ XML parsing and regular expressions alternatively. Just last week the PyQuery parsing broke, and the regex still worked. Yes weird, and I can&#39;t explain it myself. But so it happened.\nSo please don&#39;t vote real-world considerations down, just because it doesn&#39;t match the regex=evil meme. But let&#39;s also not vote this up too much.

            "body": "How regex alternation is implemented in Perl is fairly well explained in \n\n\n  Matching this or that\n  \n  We can match different character strings with the alternation\n  metacharacter  . To match  or  , we form the regex  .\n  As before, Perl will try to match the regex at the earliest possible\n  point in the string. At each character position, Perl will first try\n  to match the first alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match, Perl will\n  then try the next alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match either, then\n  the match fails and Perl moves to the next position in the string.\n  Some examples:\n\n\n  \n  Even though  is the first alternative in the second regex,  is able to match\n  earlier in the string.\n\n\n  \n  Here, all the alternatives match at the first string position, so the\n  first alternative is the one that matches. If some of the alternatives\n  are truncations of the others, put the longest ones first to give them\n  a chance to match.\n\n\n  \n  The last example points out \n  that character classes are like alternations of characters. At a given\n  character position, the first alternative that allows the regexp match\n  to succeed will be the one that matches.\n\n\nSo this should explain the price you pay when using alternations in regex.\n\nWhen putting simple regex together, you don&#39;t pay such a price. It&#39;s well explained in another related question in SO. When directly searching for a constant string, or a set of characters as in the question, optimizations can be done and no backtracking is needed which means potentially faster code.\n\nWhen defining the regex alternations, just choosing a good order (putting the most common findings first) can influence the performance. It is not the same either to choose between two options, or twenty. As always, premature optimization is the root of all evil and you should instrumentiate you code (Devel::NYTProf) if there are problems or you want improvements. But as a general rule alternations should be kept to a minimum and avoided if possible since:\n\n\nThey easily make the regex too big an complex. We like simple, easy to understand / debug / maintain regex.\nVariability and input dependant. They could be an unexpected source of problems since they backtrack and can lead to unexpected lack of performance depending on your input. As I understand, there&#39;s no case when they will be faster.\nConceptually you are trying to match two different things, so we could argue that two different statements are more correct and clear than just one.\n\n\nHope this answer gets closer to what you were expecting.\n",

First, the code:\n\n\n\nThe idea for this program is that the user enters an URL from Amazon or other sites like that and the program retrieves the image of the object, the sell price and (eventually) shipping fees. This is done by creating a sort of simple database ( will populate the list self.contenuti with some dictionaries containing the data). Now,  has to beahave exactly the same, no matter the site, and this is accomplished by creating specific classes (like the class ) that will have the specific functions for retrieving the data (every site has is own structure, so I can&#39;t use the same regex) and simply putting them in the dictionary : whenever  is called, the appropriate class (here I have only ) will be called passing  as an argument, and this will be the content of the site provided, converted into str, so the class Amazon can search the appropriate informations via regex.\n\nThis is for home uses, I already created a similar program that, with the data collected, writes a simple HTML file that is a sort of image gallery of all the objects of interest. What I want to do here, with , is downloading the image so it will be displayed into a tkinter label when I will write the GUI. No HTML file needed, the whole thing will be GUI based, like a sort of database.\n\nThe problem is that, whatever URL I provide (here I&#39;m doing it in the  function, for debug purposes) I get this evil and nasty &quot;thing&quot;: \n\n\n\nFrom what I understand, the problem is in urllib: for some reason the URL is not parsed correctly and I end up with the error. So, I tried to write this:\n\n\n\nThis is wrote in another module, for testing purpose, there is only this piece of code. If I have it for its own, it works perfectly, with no error.

The method name &#39;eval&#39; actually comes from the word &#39;evaluate&#39;, not evil.  Despite this, however, evaluation is not an objective in this scenario; parsing is.  \n\nAnother reason why people are hesitant to recommend eval for trivial tasks like data parsing is that the worst case scenario of JSON#parse is that it fails to parse.  Whereas the worst case scenario of eval is that you&#39;ve completely deleted your file system by parsing a string that you didn&#39;t expect to be there when you first designed your code.  \n",

            "body": "I have the following HTML and I need to remove the script tags and any script related attributes in the HTML. By script related attributes I mean any attribute that starts with on. \n\n\n\nMy first thought was to use BeautifulSoup to remove the tags and attributes. Unfortunately, I am unable to use BeautifulSoup. Seeing that BeautifulSoup is off the table I can see two options for doing this. The first option I see is splitting the strings and parsing based on index. This seems like a bad solution to me.\n\nThe other option is to use Regular Expressions. However, we know that isn&#39;t a good solution either (Cthulhu Parsing).\n\nNow with that in mind, I personally feel it is alright to use regular expressions to strip the attributes. After all, with those it is still simple string manipulation. \n\nSo for removing the attributes I have:\n\n\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I personally think the above perfectly acceptable use of Regular Expression with HTML. But still I would like to get some opinions on the above usage. \n\nThen there is the question of the script tags. I&#39;m very tempted to go with Regular Expressions for this because I know them and I know what I need is pretty simple. Something like:\n\n\n\nThe above would start to get me close to what I need. And yes I realize the above RegEx will grab everything starting at the first opening script tag until the last closing script tag, but it&#39;s a starting example. \n\nI&#39;m very tempted to use Regular Expressions as I&#39;m familiar with them (more so than Python) and I know that is the quickest way to achieve the results I want, at least for me it is. \n\nSo I need help to go against my nature and not be evil. I want to be evil and use RegEx so somebody please show me the light and guide me to the promised land on non-Regular Expressions.\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt looks like I wasn&#39;t very clear about what my question actually is, I apologize for that. My question is how can I parse the HTML using pure Python without Regular Expressions? \n\n\n\nAs for the above code example, it&#39;s wrong. I know it is wrong, I was using it as an example of a starting point. \n\nI hope this clears up my question some\n\nUpdate 2\n\nI just wanted to add a few more notes about what I am  doing. \n\nI am crawling a web site to get the data I need.\n\nOnce we have the page that contains the data we need it is saved to the database.\n\nThen the saved web page is displayed to the user.\n\nThe issue I am trying to solve happens here. The application throws a script error when you attempt to interact with the page that forces the user to click on a confirmation box. The application is not a web browser but uses the web browser DLL in Windows (I cannot remember the name at the moment).\n\nThe error in question only happens in this one page for this one web site.\n\nUpdate 3\n\nAfter adding the update I realized I was over thinking the problem, I was looking for a more generic solution. However, in this case that isn&#39;t what is needed. \n\nThe page is dynamically generated, however the script tags will stay static. With that in mind the solution becomes much simpler. With that I no longer need to treat it like HTML but as static strings.\n\nSo the solution I&#39;m looking at is\n\n\n\nI would like to avoid Regular Expression however, since I&#39;m limited to only using the standard library regular expressions seems like the best solution in this case.

And there is never a good reason.\nin the worst case  makes your application vulnerable to injection attacks and also it&#39;s very slow. A bit of research reveals plenty of reasons why eval is a big no-no.\nDon&#39;t save your calculation code into the database\nIf you do so and you would like to switch from PHP to another language you would still have PHP code in your database. It makes it really hard to migrate languages. You should always strive to make as many parts of your application as independent as possible.\nIn this case you would tight-couple the language you use, to the database. That&#39;s a bad practice.\nAlso the only possibilities to run your calculations from the database would be to eval them (which is bad, see above) or to disassemble the string with string operations or regex which causes unnecessary effort.\nIt&#39;s all about Strategy\nIn order to solve your problem you must execute code dependent of which calculation you need. That could be either done with switch-case-statements or if-statements. But that&#39;s also not a very elegant solution. Imagine you would need to execute other operations before calculating in the future, or extend functionality. You would need to update all your cases or if-statements.\nThere is a nice design-pattern which is called Strategy Pattern. The strategy pattern solves problems when one use-case can be handled differently which is probably what you want.\nYou want to calculate something (use-case) and there are different calculation types for it (different strategies)\nHow it works\nTo implement the Strategy pattern you basically need three things.\n\nA class where you inject your strategies. It&#39;s basically a wrapper for your strategy tasks.\nAn interface which will be implemented by your strategies\nYour strategies\n\nYour interface could look like this:\n\nThe interface will make sure that all your strategies provide a method to actually run the calculation. Nothing special.\nNext you may want to have a base class that takes your calculation operators as constructor arguments and stores them into properties.\n\nNow it&#39;s getting serious. We are implementing our strategies.\n\nOf course you could clean this one up a bit, but what I want to point out here is the class declaration.\nWe are extending our  class so that we can pass the arithmetic operations via constructor and we are implementing the  which tells our class: &quot;Hey! You must provide a calculate method, I don&#39;t care whether you want or not.\nWe&#39;ll see later why this is an integral part of the pattern.\nSo we have two concrete classes that contain the actual code for the actual arithmetic operation. If you would ever need to, you could change it easily as you see.\nTo add more operations just add another class.\nNow we will create a class where our strategies can be injected. Later you will instantiate an object of this class and work with it.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\nThe most important part here is the constructor. See how we type-hint our interface here. By doing that we make sure that only an object can be injected (Dependency Injection) whose class implements the interface. We do not need to demand a concrete class here. That&#39;s the crucial point here.\nAlso there&#39;s a calculate method in there. It&#39;s just a wrapper for our strategy to execute it&#39;s calculate method.\nWrapping it up\nSo now we just need to create an object of our  class and pass an object of one of our strategy classes (that contain the code for the arithmetic operations).\n\nTry replacing the string stored in  to  and you see that the operation for calculating the percentage will be executed.\nConclusion\nThe strategy pattern allowed you to create a clean interface for working with dynamic tasks that are only made concrete during runtime. Neither your database needs to know how we calculate things, nor your actual calculator does. The only thing we need to make sure is to code against an interface that provides a method to let us calculate things.\n",

All links to your site will still work, and additionally any bookmarks will be updated to your new url path construct.\n\nYou can set it up in Apache using mod_rewrite:\n\n\n\nThis will redirect every url path, which does not start with either , , , ,  to the  (default) sub path.\n\nEdit to comments:\n\nThe solution above would enable for all your links to work (old and new ones).\n\nIf you additionally want to change all the links on your page, so that search engines will see them, then your only option is to rewrite them in your PHP/HTML code (using JavaScript for this is a bad idea for many reasons).\n\nThe best option in this case is to write a helper function, which generates the links for you depending on current language. This way you will have a single point, where you can change your links, should they change once again in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, you won&#39;t be able to change all of your links at once. If you have thousands of them, and no common code which generates all of them, then you have to do this one by one. Good news is, that you are not the first one with this problem, and the developers of professional IDE&#39;s already implement tools to aid you. My personal choice is a commercial software, but other open sourced IDE&#39;s also have a pretty good find/replace options. You can for instance write a regex, which will find your links and replace them accordingly to the rules you provide. To write a good regex replacer might prove to be very beneficial as opposed to reviewing all links one by one.\n\nThis is one of the possible implementation of the url helper:\n\n\n\nNow you have to find all places where links are outputed and use the helper:\n\n\n\nNote that this is just an example of how it could work. I actually don&#39;t recommend to implement the helper as a static method, because static is pure evil. For your real implementation you might consider a helper object instead of helper method.\n",

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nBy sending headers inadvertently, you might have introduced a security vulnerability: say, you are doing a redirection, but hence the headers are already sent, the redirection does not work and the rest of the page might be output, thus the visitor may see what she was not supposed to see. While this can be mitigated by using exit, you know the story, only if every one of us utilize good programming habits every time.\nEven if letting the visitor stay in the wrong page does not have a security implication, by breaking a session behavior, or in some other ways I&#39;ve encountered over years, the security and/or session cycle might have taken some sort of blow in the end.\nIf not security, you may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after ?&gt;. An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

That&#39;s not what you intended, but it is the way regexes work. (The &quot;longest left-most rule&quot;.) In theory, it&#39;s still possible to match the regex without killing the stack, but I doubt whether the regex library you&#39;re using is clever enough to make that optimization.\n\nYou can fix the regex to match what you want it to match by making the data part () non-greedy: change it to .

However, we need to parse the regex if we do this.\n\nI can&#39;t speak for the future, but as of Ruby 2.0, there is no better method in the  core class.\n\nA left parenthesis denotes a literal left parenthesis, if preceded by an unescaped backslash. A backslash is unescaped unless an unescaped backslash precedes. So, a character is escaped iff preceded by an odd number of backslashes. \n\nAn unescaped left parenthesis denotes a capturing group iff not followed by a question mark. With a question mark, it can mean various things:  and  denote a named capturing group. Named and unnamed capturing groups cannot coexist in the same regex, however[2].  denote non-capturing groups. This is a special case of .  denote atomic groups. , ,  and  denote lookaround.  denote comments.\n\nRuby regexp engine supports comments in regexes. Considering them in the main regex would be very difficult. We can try to strip them if we really want to support these, but supporting them fully will get messy due to the possibility of inline flags turning extended mode (and thus line comments) on and off in ways that a regular expression cannot capture. I will go ahead and not support unescaped parentheses in regex comments[3].\n\nWe want to count:\n\n\nthe number of left parentheses \nthat are not escaped by a backslash  (read: not preceded by an odd number of backslashes that are not preceded by yet another backslash) and \nthat are not followed by a question mark \n\n\nRuby doesn&#39;t support unbounded lookbehind, but if we reverse the source first, we can rewrite the first assertion slightly: . The second assertion becomes a lookbehind: . \n\nthe whole solution\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: we can show the NP-hardness by converting the satisfiability problem to it:\n\n\nAND:  ( must be an assertion)\nOR: \nNOT: \natoms: , , , ..., , ...\n\n\nexample(XOR): \n\nthis extends to NP-completeness for any class of regexes that can be tested in polynomial time. This includes any regex with no nested repetition (or repeated backreferences to repetition or recursion) and with bounded nesting depth of optional matches.\n\n[2]:  returns , indicating that unnamed capturing groups are ignored when named capturing groups are present. Tested in Ruby 1.9.3\n\n[3]: Inline comments start with  and end with . They cannot contain an unescaped right parenthesis, but they can contain an unescaped left parenthesis. These can be stripped easily (even though we have to sprinkle the &quot;unescaped&quot; regex everywhere), are the lesser evil, but they&#39;re also less likely to contain anunescaped left parenthesis.\n\nLine comments start with  and end with a newline. These are only treated as comments in the extended mode. Outside the extended mode, they match the literal  and newline. This is still easy, even if we have to consider escaping again. Determining if the regex has the extended flag set is not too difficult, but the flag modifier groups are a different beast entirely.\n\nEven with Ruby&#39;s awesome recursive regexes, merely determining if a previously-open group modifying the extended mode is already closed would yield a very nasty regex (even if you replace one by one and don&#39;t have to skip comments, you have to account for escaping).

Anyway here is what I got..\n\n\n\nAre there ANY regexp guru&#39;s out there that could give me some pointers or a regexp that mimics what I need? Which is only getting the deepest stacked instance of a {{tag}} that ends like this {{//tag}}\n\nORIGINAL\n\nOk, so I have an issue I have seen others have, but with a different approach to it.. Or so I thought.. So I am curious if anyone else can help me solve this issue further..\n\nI have a database full of templates that I need to work with in PHP, these templates are made and used by another system, and so there for can not be changed. With that said, these templates have hierarchy style tags added to them. What I need to do, is get these templates from the database, and then programmatically find these tags, their function name (or tag name), and their inner contents, as well as anything following the function (tag) name within the brackets.. An example of one of these tags is, {{FunctionName some (otherStuff) !Here}} Some content sits inside and it ends {{/FunctionName}}\n\nThis is where it gets more fun, the templates have another random tag, which I am guessing are the &quot;variable&quot; style of these tags, as they are always generally the same syntax. Which looks like this, ${RandomTag}, but also there are times that the function style one is there but without an ending tag, like so.. {{RandomLoner}}\n\nExample Template...\n\n\n\nOk so in no way is this a real template, but it follows all the rules that I have seen thus far.\n\nNow I have tried different things with regex and preg_match_all to pull out the matches, and get each of these into a nice array. So far what I have got is this (used it on the example template to make sure its working still)\n\n\n\nI have tried a couple approaches, (that took me nearly 8 hours to get to)\n\n\n\nIn no way am I a guru with regexp, I actually just learned it over the last day or so, trying to get this to work. I have googled for this, and realize that regexp is not designed for nested stuff, but the (?R) seems to do the trick on simple bracket examples Ive seen on the internets, but they always only take into account of the stuff between the { and } or ( and ) or &lt; and &gt;. After reading nearly the whole regex info website, and playing, I came up with these 2 versions.\n\nSo what I NEED to do (I think), would have a regexp work from the DEEPEST hierarchy tag first, and work its way out (if I can do that with help from php, thats fine with me). I was thinking finding the Deepest layer, get its data, and work backwards til all the contents are in 1 fat array. I assumed that was what the ($R) was going to do for me, but it didn&#39;t.\n\nSo any help on what I am missing would be great, also take into note that mine seems to have issues with {{}} that DONT have an ending version of it. So like my {{Random}} example, was removed for the sake of me parsing the array example. I feel these tags, along with the ${} tags can be left alone (if I knew how to do that with regexp), and just remain in the text where they are. I am more or less interested in the functions and getting their data into a multidimensional array for me to work with further.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just have been banging me head all night with this. I started with the assumption that it was going to be a bit easier.. Til I realized the tags where nested :/\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thanks!\n",

            "body": "For what it is worth, most scripting languages (like Perl) and non-static compile-time languages (like Pick) support automatic run-time dynamic String to (relatively arbitrary) object conversions. This CAN be accomplished in Java as well without losing type-safety and the good stuff statically-typed languages provide WITHOUT the nasty side-effects of some of the other languages that do evil things with dynamic casting. A Perl example that does some questionable math:\n\n\n\nIn Java, this is better accomplished (IMHO) by using a method I call &quot;cross-casting&quot;.\nWith cross-casting, reflection is used in a lazy-loaded cache of constructors and methods that are dynamically discovered via the following static method: \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, no built-in Java methods such as Class.cast() will do this for String to BigDecimal or String to Integer or any other conversion where there is no supporting class hierarchy. For my part, the point is to provide a fully dynamic way to achieve this - for which I don&#39;t think the prior reference is the right approach - having to code every conversion. Simply put, the implementation is just to cast-from-string if it is legal/possible.\n\nSo the solution is simple reflection looking for public Members of either:\n\nSTRING_CLASS_ARRAY = (new Class[] {String.class});\n\na) Member member = targetClass.getMethod(method.getName(),STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\nb) Member member = targetClass.getConstructor(STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\n\nYou will find that all of the primitives (Integer, Long, etc) and all of the basics (BigInteger, BigDecimal, etc) and even java.regex.Pattern are all covered via this approach. I have used this with significant success on production projects where there are a huge amount of arbitrary String value inputs where some more strict checking was needed. In this approach, if there is no method or when the method is invoked an exception is thrown (because it is an illegal value such as a non-numeric input to a BigDecimal or illegal RegEx for a Pattern), that provides the checking specific to the target class inherent logic.\n\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\n1) You need to understand reflection well (this is a little complicated and not for novices).\n2) Some of the Java classes and indeed 3rd-party libraries are (surprise) not coded properly. That is, there are methods that take a single string argument as input and return an instance of the target class but it isn&#39;t what you think... Consider the Integer class:\n\n\n\nThe above method really has nothing to do with Integers as objects wrapping primitives ints.\nReflection will find this as a possible candidate for creating an Integer from a String incorrectly versus the decode, valueof and constructor Members - which are all suitable for most arbitrary String conversions where you really don&#39;t have control over your input data but just want to know if it is possible an Integer.\n\nTo remedy the above, looking for methods that throw Exceptions is a good start because invalid input values that create instances of such objects should throw an Exception. Unfortunately, implementations vary as to whether the Exceptions are declared as checked or not. Integer.valueOf(String) throws a checked NumberFormatException for example, but Pattern.compile() exceptions are not found during reflection lookups. Again, not a failing of this dynamic &quot;cross-casting&quot; approach I think so much as a very non-standard implementation for exception declarations in object creation methods.\n\nIf anyone would like more details on how the above was implemented, let me know but I think this solution is much more flexible/extensible and with less code without losing the good parts of type-safety. Of course it is always best to &quot;know thy data&quot; but as many of us find, we are sometimes only recipients of unmanaged content and have to do the best we can to use it properly.\n\nCheers.\n",

I also realized there&#39;d still be problems with other legitimate matches, such as EVIL: .\n\nSo what it appears I really need is the negation of preceding html entities missing a semicolon:\n\n\n\nBut it is still matching and I&#39;m not sure why.\n\nIt would be ideal to still get returned matches that can be replaced wholesale without further inspection, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.  What is not suitable is first parsing out the html entities, because sometimes they&#39;re necessary and/or part of a legitimate smiley (as with EVIL).\n\n\n\nEDIT (some Google food):\n\nI discovered (and Bryan also noted below) that Zero-width positive lookbehind, , would work as desired (not Zero-width negative lookahead ).\n\nAs per regular-expressions.info, the latter &quot;will only succeed if the regex inside the lookahead fails to match&quot; which sounds right, but isn&#39;t when the section is optional anyway.\n\nIn contrast, the former &quot;matches at a position if the pattern inside the lookahead can be matched ending at that position&quot; which isn&#39;t at all clear, but does the trick.  Because the match is using lookbehind, there&#39;s no chance of backtracking to satisfy the latter portion of the regex.\n\nSo a full regex looks like:\n\n\n\nand that matches these:    while failing this:  \nIt does however still match , so more tweaking would be ideal (such as additionally matching semicolons in place of the ampersands, if that doesn&#39;t cause other smileys with entities in them to break).  People typing out html entities in chat isn&#39;t likely to come up much anyway.\n\nEither way would be &quot;good enough&quot;--except that javascript doesn&#39;t support negative lookbehind.  But it&#39;s worth explaining for the sake of other regex implementations.\n",

It takes any alphabet, whitespace, or hyphen character and turns it into the number . The problem is that it thinks the negative sign in  is &quot;evil text&quot; to turn into a number.\n\nOne way to approach this is to provide an anchor for your regex - Make it match the commas (or beginning/ending of the string) surrounding the text. So it would see  and turn it into  but would see  and know that it&#39;s not text.\n\nAnother approach is to filter based on &quot;does it not contain digits&quot; instead of &quot;does it contain these things I need&quot; - because what if, later, you need to filter out other punctuation marks? Using  would match &quot;things that aren&#39;t digits or commas&quot;, which would turn  into  but keep  the same.\n\nA third approach is to split the string on commas, then test and change each individual segment - probably to see if it contains digits - and then join them back together.\n\nIf you choose the first or second approaches, I leave it up to you to write a regex that either matches a leading comma or the beginning of a string (and a trailing comma or the end of the string - both are similar).

A RegularExpressionValidator can just be dragged and dropped into your ASPX code, and all you&#39;d have to write would be 10-21 characters of regex. With a CustomValidator, you&#39;d have to write custom validation functions, both in the codebehind and the JavaScript.

            "body": "Overview\n\nAround the end of 2009, I wrote a simple templating system for PHP/HTML to be used in-house by our designers for brochure-ware type websites. The goal of the system is to allow templating in otherwise pure HTML via custom tags that are processed by PHP. For example, a templated page might look like this:\n\n\n\nThe template itself might look something like this:\n\n\n\nBesides the Page and Content/Container tags, there are a few other tags included in the core for stuff like flow control, iterating over a collection, outputting dynamic values, etc. The framework is designed so it&#39;s very easy to add your own set of tags registered under another prefix and namespace.\n\nCustom Tags to PHP\n\nHow do we parse these custom tags? Since the&#39;re no guarantee that the HTML file is well-formed XML, solutions like XSLT/XPATH won&#39;t be reliable. Instead, we use a regex to look for tags with registered prefixes, and replace those with PHP code. The PHP code is a stack-based design... upon encountering an opening tag, an object representing the tag is created pushed onto the stack, and its &quot;initialization function&quot; (if any) runs. Whenever a registered closing tag is encountered, the most recent object is popped off the stack, and its &quot;rendering function&quot; runs.\n\nSo, after the framework replaces the templating tags with PHP, our example page might look something like this (in realty it&#39;s a bit uglier):\n\n\n\nThe good, the bad, and \n\nNow, how to execute our newly-generated PHP code? I can think of a few options here. The easiest is to simply  the string, and that works well enough. However, any programmer will tell you &quot;eval is evil, don&#39;t use it...&quot; so the question is, is there anything more appropriate than  that we can use here? \n\nI&#39;ve considered using a temporary or cached file, using  output streams, etc, but as far as I can see these don&#39;t offer any real advantage over . Caching could speed things up, but in practice all the sites we have on this thing are already blazingly fast, so I see no need to make speed optimizations at this point.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor each of the things on this list: is it a good idea? Can you think of a better alternative?\n\n\nthe whole idea in general (custom tags for html / php)\nconverting tags to php code instead of processing directly\nthe stack-based approach \nthe use of  (or similar)\n\n\nThanks for reading and TIA for any advice. :)\n",

This lets you iterate over each individual character, which more clearly indicates your intent, is less prone to bugs as you know you&#39;re treating each character at once, and is more efficient*.  Likewise your valid character sets should also be characters.\n\nYour logic is pretty strangely expressed; you&#39;re not even referencing the specialChars set at all, and the looping logic once you&#39;ve found a match seems odd.  I think this is your bug; the matching seems to be the wrong way round in that if the character matches the first valid char, you set flag to  and continue round the current loop; so it will definitely not match the next valid char and hence you break out of the loop with a  flag.  Always.\n\nI would have thought something like this would be more intuitive:\n\n\n\nThis doesn&#39;t take sequences into account (e.g. the strings &quot;--------**  &quot; and &quot;1&quot; would be valid because all individual characters are valid) but then neither does your original code.

You could name each entry in the file and load them all into a hash table for easy access from your code.\n\nSecond choice, create a file that will be pre-processed into a java interface; it could escape the regex as it does so.  Personally I hate code generation, but if the java file is 100% never human edited, it&#39;s not too bad (the real evil is generated files that you are expected to edit!)\n\nThird (tricky and probably a bad idea): You might be able to create a custom doclet that will extract strings from your comments into a text file or a header file at compile time, then use one of the other two methods above.  This keeps your strings in the same file in which they are being used.  This could be really hard to do correctly, and the penalties of failure are extreme, so I wouldn&#39;t even consider it unless I had an overwhelming need and some pretty impressive talent.\n\nI only suggest this because comments are free-form and things within a &quot;pre&quot; tag are pretty safe from formatters and other system uglies.  The doclet could extract this before printing the javadocs, and could even add some of the generated javadocs indicating your use of regex strings.\n\nBefore downvoting and telling me this is a stupid idea--I KNOW, I just thought I&#39;d suggest it because it&#39;s interesting, but my preference as I stated above is a simple text file...\n",

If that doesn&#39;t,\nREMOVE THE BINARY because the program is badly behaved.\nAs a general principle we don&#39;t use Unix Railgun to trim the hedges.  https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#kill\nExplanation of above command:\n produces a list of process id&#39;s on the computer visible to this user.  The pipe grep filters that down for rows containing that string.  The  says don&#39;t match on the process itself doing the grepping.  The pipe awk print says split the rows on default delimiter whitespace and filter to the second column which is our process id.  The pipe xargs spins up a new process to send all those pid&#39;s to , ending them all.\nWhy  is bad, dangerous, ugly and hackish:\n\nThere&#39;s a small possibility that you will accidentally end the operating system or cause undefined behavior in an unrelated process, leading to whole system instability because  lists thousands of processes, and you can&#39;t be sure some 3rd party process shares your process name, or that in the time between read and execute kill -9, the processid had changed to something else, and now you&#39;ve ended some random necessary process unrelated to yours.\n\nIf the code being force-ended is doing any database ops or secure transactions with low probability race conditions, some fraction of a percent of the time, atomicity of that transaction will be wrecked, producing undefined behavior.  kill -9 takes no prisoners.  If your code is sensitive to this, try replacing the  part with a transmitted flag that requests a graceful shutdown, and only if that request is denied, last-resort to \n\n\nBut, if you understand all the risks and control for them with unique names, and you&#39;re ok with a few dropped transactions or occasional corruption, then 99.9% of the time yer gonna be fine. If there&#39;s a problem, reboot the computer, make sure there aren&#39;t any process collisions.  It&#39;s because of code like this that makes the tech support script: &quot;Have you tried restarting your computer&quot; a level 5 meme.  &quot;A Rogue Robot scraped  to find integers and sent those to , so reboot the computer to clear the problem.\nWhy not just use  which is easier?\nThe above gives me manual control because , , ,  and  are multi-platform standard.

            "body": "I know how terribly wrong it is to (attempt to) parse HTML with Regex, which is why I&#39;m trying really, really hard to avoid it.\n\nI have an app that generates HTML emails. We&#39;re using a big fancy WYSIWYG drop in email editor that takes care of generating responsive emails and also generates the abysmal markup for clients like MS Outlook. It does that last bit using conditional comments, which look something like the following. Note that the  has an  attribute, and wraps the  tag that non-mso clients will see.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one of dozens (possibly hundreds?) of possible formattings that we need to work with.\n\nPrior to the introduction of this editor, we asked our customers to generate their own HTML emails with a more rudimentary WYSIWYG HMTL editor; but it was incumbent on them to make responsive templates and test their content in various clients. From their perspective, this new editor is a huge win.\n\nAs we&#39;re sending emails, it&#39;s important to track the link clicks via a tracking link that redirects through to the originally-intended link.\n\nTo date, we&#39;ve used jSoup to parse the email content, looking for any anchor tags and replace their href attribute contents. Because regex html parsing is evil, right?\n\nConditional comments have thrown a wrench in those gears.\n\nBecause they are comments, jSoup ignores them, and clicks from MS Outlook and other clients that handle the  markup haven&#39;t been transformed to go through our link tracker, so the clicks don&#39;t get tracked. This is a problem for us.\n\n\n\nFirst idea: replace the conditional comments with a custom tag\n\nAt first I was hopeful to pre-process the message body before letting jSoup have it. I would replace  with  and  with . This was simple enough to do, even for complex forms of the conditions inside the comments. I used a regex to make some simple replacements:\n\n\n became \n became  \netc\n\n\nNotice that I url-encoded the original comment in its entirety. url-encoding it made sure that I could easily use regex to find my marker comments and transform them back (so that I didn&#39;t have to worry about  inside the &quot;orig&quot; attribute content...\n\nThis started to break down when I realized there were multiple possible ways the comments could be closed. I spent a little bit of time working on a similar approach for the closing tags.\n\n\n became \nsame approach for  and \n\n\nI don&#39;t know if you can have attributes on a closing tag. I never tested it because I had another realization before I got to that point. The realization was that using  wasn&#39;t going to produce desirable output from jSoup because the resulting INPUT would often look like:\n\n\n\nThis is not tidy HTML and jSoup will try to correct it, changing the order of tags to make something that it thinks is more correct. When I realized that, I stopped what I was doing and started thinking about the problem again.\n\n\n\nSecond idea: the same thing, but with comments\n\nIf the (new) problem was that jSoup didn&#39;t like my tag nesting, what if I could expose the HTML from inside the conditional comments as if it weren&#39;t commented out, but keep some markers in as comments that I can later transform back into comments? The goal was to aim at making this:\n\n\n\nThis should parse as fairly tidy HTML, right? So I made the code modifications and gave it a shot.\n\nSadly, the documents that we&#39;re working with are far more complex than the simple example I started from above. Here&#39;s the first few lines of an actual sample document:\n\n\n\nAfter the comment conversion, we&#39;ve effectively dropped an  block into the  block, of which jSoup is decidedly not a fan. This is what I get back for the above input, after converting the conditional comments into my plain marked comments, parsing with jSoup, and then converting my markers back to their conditional comments:\n\n\n\nThere are some big problems here. The  block gets basically immediately closed. The  tag moves up to before the  block, and everything that came after it moved down into the body. This isn&#39;t going to work.\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\nI feel like we&#39;re basically out of options. \n\n\nDo nothing and just don&#39;t count the clicks from MS Outlook/etc clients. In some cases we might be able to detect a click anyway via a downstream conversion on that email. (Even if we don&#39;t have record of you clicking the link, if you made a payment then we know you got there...)\nWe could let our mail provider do the link tracking for us (experimentation required; not positive they would track the  links either). Historically we started this system with a provider that didn&#39;t offer link tracking so we had to roll our own. Current provider offers it, but we&#39;ve got years of existing code and processes that would have to be updated to support this change. We&#39;re keeping it in our back pocket if we can&#39;t figure something else out, but the prospect of changing ships mid-stream is ... not appealing.\nOr lastly... maybe... regex? (/me ducks) We could let jSoup do its thing for the normal HTML, and then use regex to replace any links that remain. This becomes a game of whack-a-mole with current and future markup. What might we run into aside from a  in the future? &#175;\\_(ツ)_/&#175; And we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing without regular manual reviews.\n\n\nUnless there&#39;s another option that we haven&#39;t explored yet.

            "body": "The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Solution for Removing &quot;.html&quot; in NGINX:\nUPDATED ANSWER: This question piqued my curiosity, and I went on another, more in-depth search for a &quot;holy grail&quot; solution for  redirects in NGINX. Here is the link to the answer I found, since I didn&#39;t come up with it myself: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32966347/4175718\nHowever, I&#39;ll give an example and explain how it works. Here is the code:\n\nWhat&#39;s happening here is a pretty ingenious use of the  directive. NGINX runs a regex on the  portion of incoming requests. The regex checks if the URI has an .html extension and then stores the extension-less portion of the URI in the built-in variable .\nFrom the docs, since it took me a while to figure out where the  came from:\n\nRegular expressions can contain captures that are made available for later reuse in the $1..$9 variables.\n\nThe regex both checks for the existence of unwanted .html requests and effectively sanitizes the URI so that it does not include the extension. Then, using a simple  statement, the request is redirected to the sanitized URI that is now stored in .\nThe best part about this, as original author cnst explains, is that\n\nDue to the fact that $request_uri is always constant per request, and is not affected by other rewrites, it won&#39;t, in fact, form any infinite loops.\n\nUnlike the rewrites, which operate on any  request (including the invisible internal redirect to ), this solution only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.\nWhat does &quot;try_files&quot; do?\nYou will still need the  directive, as otherwise NGINX will have no idea what to do with the newly sanitized extension-less URIs. The  directive shown above will first try the new URL by itself, then try it with the &quot;.html&quot; extension, then try it as a directory name.\nThe NGINX docs also explain how the default  directive works. The default  directive is ordered differently than the example above so the explanation below does not perfectly line up:\n\nNGINX will first append  to the end of the URI and try to serve it. If it finds an appropriate  file, it will return that file and will maintain the extension-less URI. If it cannot find an appropriate  file, it will try the URI without any extension, then the URI as a directory, and then finally return a 404 error.\n\nUPDATE: What does the regex do?\nThe above answer touches on the use of regular expressions, but here is a more specific explanation for those who are still curious. The following regular expression (regex) is used:\n\nThis breaks down as:\n: indicates beginning of line.\n: match the character &quot;/&quot; literally. Forward slashes do NOT need to be escaped in NGINX.\n: capturing group: match any character an unlimited number of times\n: match the character &quot;.&quot; literally. This must be escaped with a backslash.\n: match the string &quot;html&quot; literally.\n: match a literal &quot;?&quot; or the end of the string. This is done to avoid mishandling file names with something after &quot;.html&quot;.\nThe capturing group  is what contains the non-&quot;.html&quot; portion of the URL. This can later be referenced with the variable . NGINX is then configured to re-try the request () and the  directive internally re-appends the &quot;.html&quot; extension so the file can be located.\nUPDATE: Retaining the query string\nTo retain query strings and arguments passed to a  page, the  statement can be changed to:\n\nThis should allow requests such as  to redirect to  instead of just .\n\nNote that this is considered safe usage of the `if` directive.\nFrom the NGINX page If Is Evil:\n\nThe only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:\nreturn ...;\nrewrite ... last;\n\n\nAlso, note that you may swap out the &#39;302&#39; redirect for a &#39;301&#39;.\nA  redirect is permanent, and is cached by web browsers and search engines. If your goal is to permanently remove the  extension from pages that are already indexed by a search engine, you will want to use a  redirect. However, if you are testing on a live site, it is best practice to start with a  and only move to a  when you are absolutely confident your configuration is working correctly.\n",

Fortunately, there is a way to avoid such a problems, and can be easily applied to an arbitrary number of sites as you ask for in your original question. You can check required conditions to make a decision for blocking the request or not using the (very powerful)  block feature. And since we want to match address against a list of subnets, we will use a chain of  and  blocks. To use regexes (PRCE/PCRE2 syntax) for a  block match use a  string prefix ( for case-insensitive match), strings containing some special characters (e.g. curly braces) should be single- or double-qouted. Here is a generic example (you&#39;ll need only the first line of the following  block to fulfill your question requirements):\n\nYou can swap the logic to check the URI first (it can be some performance impact since the regex matching will be performed for every request including requests from the non-restricted networks, however if the majority of requests come from public addresses, there will be no significant difference).

For example, path rules for either /videos/hd or /videos/hd/* do not apply to a URL with the path /video/hd-abcd. However, a path rule for /video/* does apply to that path.\n\n\nPath matchers (and URL maps in general) do not offer features that function like Apache LocationMatch directives. If you have an application that generates dynamic URL paths that have a common prefix, such as /videos/hd-abcd and /videos/hd-pqrs, and you need to send requests made to those paths to different backend services, you might not be able to do that with a URL map. For simple cases containing only a few possible dynamic URLs, you might be able to create a path matcher with a limited set of path rules.

However, software engineers have added many extensions that take these implementations far beyond the formal definition. So, while most regular expression engines resemble one another, there is actually no standard. For this reason, a lot depends on what language, API, framework or library you are using.\n(Incidentally, to help reduce confusion, many have taken to using &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot; to describe these enhanced matching languages. See Is a Regex the Same as a Regular Expression? at RexEgg.com for more information.)\nThat said, most regex engines (actually, all of them, as far as I know) would accept . Most likely, there&#39;s an issue with escaping.\nThe Trouble with Escaping\nSome languages have built-in support for regexes, such as JavaScript. For those languages that don&#39;t, escaping can be a problem.\nThis is because you are basically coding in a language within a language. Java, for example, uses  as an escape character within it&#39;s strings, so if you want to place a literal backslash character within a string, you must escape it:\n\nHowever, regexes also use the  character for escaping, so if you want to match a literal  character, you must escape it for the regex engine, and then escape it again for Java:\n\nIn your case, you have probably not escaped the backslash character in the language you are programming in:\n\nAll this escaping can get very confusing. If the language you are working with supports raw strings, then you should use those to cut down on the number of backslashes, but not all languages do (most notably: Java). Fortunately, there&#39;s an alternative that will work some of the time:\n\nFor a regex engine,  and  mean exactly the same thing. Note that this doesn&#39;t work in every case, like newline (), open square bracket () and backslash ( or ).\nA Note about Matching Numbers\n(Hint: It&#39;s harder than you think)\nMatching a number is one of those things you&#39;d think is quite easy with regex, but it&#39;s actually pretty tricky. Let&#39;s take a look at your approach, piece by piece:\n\nMatch an optional  or \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\n\nMatch an optional \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\nFirst, we can clean up this expression a bit by using a character class shorthand for the digits (note that this is also susceptible to the escaping issue mentioned above):\n = \nI&#39;m going to use  below, but keep in mind that it means the same thing as . (Well, actually, in some engines  will match digits from all scripts, so it&#39;ll match more than  will, but that&#39;s probably not significant in your case.)\nNow, if you look at this carefully, you&#39;ll realize that every single part of your pattern is optional. This pattern can match a 0-length string; a string composed only of  or ; or, a string composed only of a . This is probably not what you&#39;ve intended.\nTo fix this, it&#39;s helpful to start by &quot;anchoring&quot; your regex with the bare-minimum required string, probably a single digit:\n\nNow we want to add the decimal part, but it doesn&#39;t go where you think it might:\n\nThis will still match values like . Worse, it&#39;s got a tinge of evil about it. The period is optional, meaning that you&#39;ve got two repeated classes side-by-side ( and ). This can actually be dangerous if used in just the wrong way, opening your system up to DoS attacks.\nTo fix this, rather than treating the period as optional, we need to treat it as required (to separate the repeated character classes) and instead make the entire decimal portion optional:\n\nThis is looking better now. We require a period between the first sequence of digits and the second, but there&#39;s a fatal flaw: we can&#39;t match  because a leading digit is now required.\nThis is actually pretty easy to fix. Instead of making the &quot;decimal&quot; portion of the number optional, we need to look at it as a sequence of characters: 1 or more numbers that may be prefixed by a  that may be prefixed by 0 or more numbers:\n\nNow we just add the sign:\n\nOf course, those slashes are pretty annoying in Java, so we can substitute in our long-form character classes:\n\nMatching versus Validating\nThis has come up in the comments a couple times, so I&#39;m adding an addendum on matching versus validating.\nThe goal of matching is to find some content within the input (the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;). The goal of validating is to ensure that the input is in an expected format.\nRegexes, by their nature, only match text. Given some input, they will either find some matching text or they will not. However, by &quot;snapping&quot; an expression to the beginning and ending of the input with anchor tags ( and ), we can ensure that no match is found unless the entire input matches the expression, effectively using regexes to validate.\nThe regex described above () will match one or more numbers within a target string. So given the input:\n\nThe regex will match , , ,  and .\nTo validate that a given input is a number and nothing but a number, &quot;snap&quot; the expression to the start and end of the input by wrapping it in anchor tags:\n\nThis will only find a match if the entire input is a floating point number, and will not find a match if the input contains additional characters. So, given the input , a match will be found, but given  no matches will be found.\nNote that some regex engines have a ,  or similar function, which essentially does what I&#39;ve described automatically, returning  if a match is found and  if no match is found. Also keep in mind that some engines allow you to set flags which change the definition of  and , matching the beginning/end of a line rather than the beginning/end of the entire input. This is typically not the default, but be on the lookout for these flags.\n",

            "body": "You can read this blog post that explains what most C# MIME parsers get wrong and why MimeKit can handle multiple charset encodings.\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/time-for-rant-on-mime-parsers.html\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-decoding-rfc2047-encoded-headers-is.html\nTime for a rant on mime parsers...\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\nWhere should I begin?\nI guess I should start by saying that I am obsessed with MIME and, in particular, MIME parsers. No, really. I am obsessed. Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ve written and/or worked on several MIME parsers at this point. It started off in my college days working on Spruce which had a horrendously bad MIME parser, and so as you read farther along in my rant about shitty MIME parsers, keep in mind: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve written a shitty MIME parser.\nAs a handful of people are aware, I&#39;ve recently started implementing a C# MIME parser called MimeKit. As I work on this, I&#39;ve been searching around on GitHub and Google to see what other MIME parsers exist out there to find out what sort of APIs they provide. I thought perhaps I&#39;ll find one that offers a well-designed API that will inspire me. Perhaps, by some miracle, I&#39;d find one that was actually pretty good that I could just contribute to instead of writing my own from scratch (yea, wishful thinking). Instead, all I have found are poorly designed and implemented MIME parsers, many probably belong on the front page of the Daily WTF.\nI guess I&#39;ll start with some softballs.\nFirst, there&#39;s the fact that every single one of them was written as  parsers. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ones claiming to be &quot;stream parsers&quot;, because all any of those did was to slap a  on top of the byte stream and start using . What&#39;s so bad about that, you ask? For those not familiar with MIME, I&#39;d like for you to take a look at the raw email sources in your inboxes particularly if you have correspondence with anyone outside of the US. Hopefully, most of your friends and colleagues are using more-or-less MIME compliant email clients, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find at least a few emails with raw 8bit text.\nNow, if the language they were using was C or C++, they might be able to get away with doing this because they&#39;d technically be operating on byte arrays, but with Java and C#, a &#39;string&#39; is a unicode string. Tell me: how does one get a unicode string from a raw byte array?\nBingo. You need to know the charset before you can convert those bytes into unicode characters.\nTo be fair, there&#39;s really no good way of handling raw 8bit text in message headers, but by using a  approach, you are really limiting the possibilities.\nNext up is the  approach. One of the 2 early parsers in GMime (pan-mime-parser.c back in the version 0.7 days) used a  approach, so I understand the thinking behind this. And really, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this approach as far as correctness goes, it&#39;s more of a &quot;this can never be fast&quot; complaint. Of the two early parsers in GMime, the pan-mime-parser.c backend was horribly slow compared to the in-memory parser. Of course, that&#39;s not very surprising. More surprising to me at the time was that when I wrote GMime&#39;s current generation of the parser (sometime between v0.7 and v1.0), it was just as fast as the in-memory parser ever was and only ever had up to 4k in a read buffer at any given time. My point is, there are far better approaches than  if you want your parser to be reasonably performant... and why wouldn&#39;t you want that? Your users definitely want that.\nOkay, now come the more serious problems that I encountered in nearly all of the mime parser libraries I found.\nI think that every single mime parser I&#39;ve found so far uses the &quot;String.Split()&quot; approach for parsing address headers and/or for parsing parameter lists on headers such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition.\nHere&#39;s an example from one C# MIME parser:\n\nHere&#39;s how this same parser decodes encoded-word tokens:\n\nWhat?! It completely throws away the charset in each of those encoded-word tokens. In the case of quoted-printable tokens, it assumes they are all ASCII (actually, latin1 may work as well?) and in the case of base64 encoded-word tokens, it assumes they are all in UTF-7!?!? Where in the world did he get that idea? I can&#39;t begin to imagine his code working on any base64 encoded-word tokens in the real world. &#129318;‍♂️\nI&#39;d just like to point out that this is what this project&#39;s description states:\nA small, efficient, and working mime parser library written in c#.\n...\nI&#39;ve used several open-source mime parsers before, but they all either\nfail on one kind of encoding or the other, or miss some crucial\ninformation. That&#39;s why I decided to finally have a go at the problem\nmyself.\nI&#39;ll grant you that his MIME parser is small, but I&#39;d have to take issue with the &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;working&quot; adjectives. With the heavy use of string allocations and regex matching, it could hardly be considered &quot;efficient&quot;. And as the code pointed out above illustrates, &quot;working&quot; is a bit of an overstatement.\nFolks... this is what you get when you opt for a &quot;lightweight&quot; MIME parser because you think that parsers like GMime are &quot;bloated&quot;.\nOn to parser #2... I like to call this the &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; approach:\n\nI&#39;ll give this guy some credit, at least he saw that his  approach was flawed and so tried to compensate by piecing Humpty Dumpty back together again. Of course, with his String.Trim()ing, he just won&#39;t be able to put him back together again with any level of certainty. The white space in those quoted tokens may have significant meaning.\nMany of the C# MIME parsers out there like to use Regex all over the place. Here&#39;s a snippet from one parser that is entirely written in Regex (yea, have fun maintaining that...):\n\nLet&#39;s pretend that the regex pattern strings are correct in their definitions (because they are god-awful to read and I can&#39;t be bothered to double-check them), the replacing of &#39;_&#39; with a space is wrong (it should only be done in the &quot;q&quot; case) and the  is just evil. Not to mention that there could be multiple encoded words per field.Body which this code utterly fails to handle.\nGuys. I know you love regular expressions and that they are very very useful, but they are no substitute for writing a real tokenizer. This is especially true if you want to be lenient in what you accept (and in the case of MIME, you really need to be).\n",

If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

If you have only a limited number of possible functions, the safest thing to do is to simply map them, and then separate the wanted function and the arguments in the variable, using an array instead. More on that later.\nIf you wanted to provide a generic means for calling functions, you could for example:\n\nI&#39;m using  here, since  is a language statement and not a function, and therefore wouldn&#39;t work like this. If you had to echo here, you&#39;d have to make your own echo wrapper function, like , and call that instead.\nOr, for more readable code, you could list the array as:\n\nIf you needed multiple arguments, you could use this structure:\n\nWhere the arguments listed in the arguments array, unpacked with the splat operator, are in the same order as the target function&#39;s arguments.\nThere are of course only a limited number of useful functions that will directly output anything. Therefore, in the above example we capture the result from  instead and then echo; this simply to illustrate the basic use of variable functions and arguments.\nThis approach will however provide unhinged access to any function in your system, and as such shouldn&#39;t be used on anything but data/calls from trusted sources (you). Allowing users to provide any commands will open up your system to a world of mischief and misery.\nTherefore, my initial recommendation of providing a map of functions. You could:\n\nHave an array with a list of allowed core functions,\nHave an array with a list of your custom wrapper functions, or\nCheck for valid wrapper functions named with a prefix\n\nYou could for example implement wrappers as follows:\n\nThis would give you control over what&#39;s executed, and also whether values are returned or output, etc. pre/post-process. And then iterate your variable commands as follows:\n\nFor an additional layer of insulation, create a class with your custom calls as its methods, instead of polluting the global space with more functions. Ciykd use a public router method that handles no-match cases; calling e.g. , where  returns the  methods.\nI often do something like this when I need to map user requests to class public methods that return output; named e.g. ,  etc. and  for a fallback for unmatched requests.

Notably:\n\nFor use cases restricted to type annotations, Python files with the  future-import (available since Python 3.7) can parameterize standard collections, including builtins.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, when  is used, function and variable annotations can parameterize standard collections directly. Example:\n\n\nWhile the above toy example does technically parse, that&#39;s about all it does. Attempting to actually use a parametrized builtin collection at runtime under either Python 3.7 or 3.8 invariably raises the dreaded  exception:\n\nNote the  statement is the standard idiom for resolving PEP 563-style postponed annotations at runtime. Don&#39;t even get me started on PEP 563.\nwho you gonna believe: me or your lying PEP?\nThis discourages the devout Pythonista in me. PEP 585 repeatedly claims that it preserves runtime usability:\n\nPreserving the generic type at runtime enables introspection of the type which can be used for API generation or runtime type checking. Such usage is already present in the wild.\n\n\nJust like with the  module today, the parameterized generic types listed in the previous section all preserve their type parameters at runtime:\n\n\nOf course, none of the above works under Python 3.7 or 3.8 – regardless of whether  is enabled or not:\n\nSo PEP 585 blatantly breaks the wild and all existing attempts to introspect generic types at runtime – especially from runtime type checkers. The entire &quot;Parameters to generics are available at runtime&quot; section is a charade.\nAm I missing something painfully obvious or are parametrized builtin collections the poison pill they superficially appear to be? Since evaluating these collections at runtime under Python 3.7 and 3.8 unconditionally raises exceptions, they&#39;re unusable at runtime – rendering them not simply useless but directly harmful for the widespread use case of type introspection and especially runtime type checking.\nbetween a rock and a hard PEP\nAny codebase type-hinting with parametrized builtin collections will be fundamentally incompatible with runtime type checkers under Python 3.7 and 3.8. Codebases preferring runtime to static type checking while preserving backward compatibility with Python &lt; 3.9 (which has yet to even be officially released as of this writing) thus have no choice but to avoid parametrized builtin collections entirely.\nExcept that too is infeasible. Why? Because PEP 585 deprecates the entire hierarchy of  pseudo-containers:\n\nImporting those [e.g., , , ] from  is deprecated. Due to PEP 563 and the intention to minimize the runtime impact of , this deprecation will not generate . Instead, type checkers may warn about such deprecated usage when the target version of the checked program is signalled to be Python 3.9 or newer. It&#39;s recommended to allow for those warnings to be silenced on a project-wide basis.\n\n\nThe deprecated functionality will be removed from the  module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0.\n\nConsider , for example. By 2025 (or shortly thereafter),  and thus  goes away. But  isn&#39;t safely parametrizable under Python 3.7 and 3.8, because doing so renders your project incompatible with anything that introspects types. So  isn&#39;t a viable option, either.\nSo there are no forward- and backward-compatible options. Instead, either:\n\nProhibit type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) entirely by just preferring builtin containers (e.g., ) to  pseudo-containers (e.g., ) or...\nSupport type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) by either:\n\nPreferring  pseudo-containers to builtin containers until 2025. At that time, both the project in question and all downstream projects of that project will need to be refactored as follows:\n\nDrop Python 3.7 and 3.8 support.\nReplace all  pseudo-containers with builtin containers.\n\n\nImmediately dropping Python 3.7 and 3.8 support by preferring builtin containers to  pseudo-containers. This has the distasteful disadvantage of requiring a currently unstable Python interpreter, but... that&#39;s technically an option. Somehow.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, there are no good options – only a spectrum of increasingly horrifying lessers of several malignant evils. One would hope that PEP authors would actually test their implementations at runtime. Yet, here we are, adrift without a paddle in a steaming cesspit of theorycrafted anti-APIs. Welcome to Python.\nbut that&#39;s not all\nThere is technically a third way. It&#39;s even more distasteful – but it should technically work. One awful theorycrafting deserves another, I always say!\nSince PEP 563-driven postponed annotations are merely strings, type introspection could cleverly run a regex-based replacement on each type being introspected. For each type that is a postponed annotation, globally replace each substring referencing a parametrized builtin container (e.g., ) in that annotation string with the corresponding substring referencing a parametrized  pseudo-container (e.g., ).\nThe result? A Python 3.7- and 3.8-compatible postponed annotation string safely evaluatable until 2025, at which point that internal replacement (and Python 3.7 and 3.8 support) could just be quietly dropped.\nThat&#39;s a totally cray-cray ludicrous speed kludge for the stars, but... that would probably work. The core issue, of course, is that one shouldn&#39;t need insane hackery just to comply with core official PEPs. But there&#39;s an even deeper underlying cultural issue underneath that technical issue. No one – neither the author of PEP 585 nor any of the commentators reviewing PEP 585 – actually tested their new hypothetical proposed functionality before deprecating the existing well-tested functionality that actually worked.\nCore official PEPs should just work out of the box. Increasingly, they don&#39;t. And that should concern everyone.\n",

            "body": "Oh Yes You Can Use Regexes to Parse HTML!\nFor the task you are attempting, regexes are perfectly fine!\nIt is true that most people underestimate the difficulty of parsing HTML with regular expressions and therefore do so poorly.\nBut this is not some fundamental flaw related to computational theory. That silliness is parroted a lot around here, but don’t you believe them.\nSo while it certainly can be done (this posting serves as an existence proof of this incontrovertible fact), that doesn’t mean it&#160;should&#160;be.\nYou must decide for yourself whether you’re up to the task of writing what amounts to a dedicated, special-purpose HTML parser out of regexes. Most people are not.\nBut I am. ☻\n\nGeneral Regex-Based HTML Parsing Solutions\nFirst I’ll show how easy it is to parse arbitrary HTML with regexes. The full program’s at the end of this posting, but the heart of the parser is:\n\nSee how easy that is to read?\nAs written, it identifies each piece of HTML and tells  where it found that piece. You could easily modify it to do whatever else you want with any given type of piece, or for more particular types than these.\nI have no failing test cases (left :): I’ve successfully run this code on more than 100,000 HTML files — every single one I could quickly and easily get my hands on. Beyond those, I’ve also run it on files specifically constructed to break na&#239;ve parsers.\nThis is not a na&#239;ve parser.\nOh, I’m sure it isn’t perfect, but I haven’t managed to break it yet.  I figure that even if something did, the fix would be easy to fit in because of the program’s clear structure. Even regex-heavy programs should have stucture.\nNow that that’s out of the way, let me address the OP’s question.\nDemo of Solving the OP’s Task Using Regexes\nThe little  program I include below produces the following output, so that you can see that parsing HTML with regexes works just fine for what you wish to do:\n\nParse Input Tags, See No Evil Input\nHere’s the source for the program that produced the output above.\n\nThere you go! Nothing to it! :)\nOnly  you can judge whether your skill with regexes is up to any particular parsing task. Everyone’s level of skill is different, and every new task is different. For jobs where you have a well-defined input set, regexes are obviously the right choice, because it is trivial to put some together when you have a restricted subset of HTML to deal with. Even regex beginners should be handle those jobs with regexes.  Anything else is overkill.\nHowever, once the HTML starts becoming less nailed down, once it starts to ramify in ways you cannot predict but which are perfectly legal, once you have to match more different sorts of things or with more complex dependencies, you will eventually reach a point where you have to work harder to effect a solution that uses regexes than you would have to using a parsing class. Where that break-even point falls  depends again on your own comfort level with regexes.\nSo What Should I Do?\nI’m not going to tell you what you must do or what you cannot do.  I think that’s Wrong. I just want to present you with possibilties, open your eyes a bit. You get to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. There are no absolutes — and nobody else knows your own situation as well as you yourself do. If something seems like it’s too much work, well, maybe it is.  Programming should be fun, you know. If it isn’t, you may be doing it wrong.\nOne can look at my  program in any number of valid ways.  One such is that you indeed can parse HTML with regular expressions. But another is that it is much, much, much harder than almost anyone ever thinks it is. This can easily lead to the conclusion that my program is a testament to what you should not do, because it really is too hard.\nI won’t disagree with that.  Certainly if everything I do in my program doesn’t make sense to you after some study, then you should not be attempting to use regexes for this kind of task. For specific HTML, regexes are great, but for generic HTML, they’re tantamount to madness. I use parsing classes all the time, especially if it’s HTML I haven’t generated myself.\nRegexes  optimal for small HTML parsing problems,  pessimal for large ones\nEven if my program is taken as  illustrative of why you should not use regexes for parsing general HTML — which is OK, because I kinda meant for it to be that ☺  — it still should be an eye-opener so more people break the terribly common and nasty, nasty habit of writing unreadable, unstructured, and unmaintainable patterns.\nPatterns do not have to be ugly, and they do not have to be hard. If you create ugly patterns, it is a reflection on you, not them.\nPhenomenally Exquisite Regex Language\nI’ve been asked to point out that my proferred solution to your problem has been written in Perl. Are you surprised? Did you not notice? Is this revelation a bombshell?\nIt is true that not all other tools and programming languages are quite as convenient, expressive, and powerful when it comes to regexes as Perl is. There’s a big spectrum out there, with some being more suitable than others.  In general, the languages that have expressed regexes as part of the core language instead of as a library are easier to work with. I’ve done nothing with regexes that you couldn’t do in, say, PCRE, although you would structure the program differently if you were using C.\nEventually other languages will be catch up with where Perl is now in terms of regexes.  I say this because back when Perl started, nobody else had anything like Perl’s regexes. Say anything you like, but this is where Perl clearly won: everybody copied Perl’s regexes albeit at varying stages of their development.  Perl pioneered almost (not quite all, but almost) everything that you have come to rely on in modern patterns today, no matter what tool or language you use.  So eventually the others will catch up.\nBut they’ll only catch up to where Perl was sometime in the past, just as it is now.  Everything advances.  In regexes if nothing else, where Perl leads, others follow. Where will Perl be once everybody else finally catches up to where Perl is now?  I have no idea, but I know we too will have moved. Probably we’ll be closer to Perl₆’s style of crafting patterns.\nIf you like that kind  of thing but would like to use it in Perl₅,  you might be interested in Damian Conway’s wonderful Regexp::Grammars module. It’s completely awesome, and makes what I’ve done here in my program seem just as primitive as mine makes the patterns that people cram together without whitespace or alphabetic identifiers.  Check it out!\n\nSimple HTML Chunker\nHere is the complete source to the parser I showed the centerpiece from at the beginning of this posting.\nI am not suggesting that you should use this over a rigorously tested parsing class. But I am tired of people pretending that nobody can parse HTML with regexes just because they can’t. You clearly can, and this program is proof of that assertion.\nSure,  it isn’t easy, but it is possible!\nAnd trying to do so is a terrible waste of time, because good parsing classes exist which you should use for this task.  The right answer to people trying to parse arbitrary HTML is not that it is impossible.  That is a facile and disingenuous answer.  The correct and honest answer is that they shouldn’t attempt it because it is too much of a bother to figure out from scratch; they should not  break their back striving to re&#239;nvent a wheel that works perfectly well.\nOn the other hand, HTML that falls within a predicable subset is ultra-easy to parse with regexes. It’s no wonder people try to use them, because for small problems, toy problems perhaps, nothing could be easier. That’s why it’s so important to distinguish the two tasks — specific vs generic — as these do not necessarily demand the same approach.\nI hope in the future here to see a more fair and honest treatment of questions about HTML and regexes.\nHere’s my HTML lexer.  It doesn’t try to do a validating parse; it just identifies the lexical elements. You might think of it more as an HTML chunker than an HTML parser. It isn’t very forgiving of broken HTML, although it makes some very small allowances in that direction.\nEven if you never parse full HTML yourself (and why should you? it’s a solved problem!), this program has lots of cool regex bits that I believe a lot of people can learn a lot from.

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nYou may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\nFinally, many PHP frameworks including Symfony, Zend and Laravel (there is no mention of this in the coding guidelines but it follows the suit) and the PSR-2 standard (item 2.2) require omission of the closing tag. PHP manual itself (1,2), Wordpress, Drupal and many other PHP software I guess, advise to do so. If you simply make a habit of following the standard (and setup PHP-CS-Fixer for your code) you can forget the issue. Otherwise you will always need to keep the issue in your mind.\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after . An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

            "body": "There doesn&#39;t seem to be a great answer for this, after trying many things.\nIf there is an answer to the question it might be that there&#39;s no good way to do it. I think it doesn&#39;t hurt to look at potential solutions though and the drawbacks of each one.\n\nSolution 1\n\nUse componentWillUpdate. This is deprecated.\n\nSolution 2\n\nValidate state on render - but in your case and in most others, validation may lead to setState, which react tells you never to do in render(), but doesn&#39;t go into any detail about what will actually happen. Of course, you would have to be careful to prevent infinite loops, but if you call setState in render() upon some condition which cannot logically result in an infinite loop, then what unintended side effects could occur? \n\nSolution 3\n\nAs above, make a wrapper function to both validate and set state. But this is no good in my opinion because any state changes done with set state directly cannot be validated. Not only does setState directly not call your validation, but your validation also does not run on the items in the initial state. You might say, why would you give your component an initial state that&#39;s invalid, but I don&#39;t care, if I want to validate state I want it to validate 50000% of the time and no less.\n\nIn a complex form example, there are other issues with this. What if the validity of one field depends on the state of another field? Surely then, a function to re-validate a field when it changes is not enough. Some people will say to test the field being passed in and dispatch multiple events for re-validation, but again, this just isn&#39;t acceptable to me. Its not fullproof, it can lead to bugs, and make things hard to test. \n\nSolution 4\n\nUse componentWillReceiveProps. Not only is this deprecated, but its also static, meaning that you don&#39;t have access to the component instance. For some components this is fine because you can still modify the state that is returned, but if your component has data outside of state and props then you cannot access it, in addition to not being able to use non-static methods, which in my opinion makes this method pretty useless in many situations.\n\nSolution 5\n\nHaven&#39;t tested this one (bear with me, its fairly nuts), but you can override setState function in your component. Insert a callback into every setState instance. Track how many times setState is called and how many times the setState callback is called. Inside the callback, you can check the two counters stored in the object to see if the last callback is currently running, then, if it is, run one function which validates all state. On render, set both of the counters back down to zero. I don&#39;t recommend this by any means. It may work but its a pretty major hack.\n\nSolution 6\n\nYou can use componentDidUpdate, but this is inefficient. You will be blindly setting state with a value that was not validated then letting your component render only to validate it after and possibly call render again. Once again you have to be careful to avoid infinite loop while calling setState in componentDidUpdate. I read elsewhere that at least if you set the state here, the DOM will only re-draw once. In other words, it doesn&#39;t draw immediately after render() but waits until componentDidUpdate is triggered and re-calls render if state changes in there. This seems like maybe its the only solution I know about that react only warns about without telling you explicitely not to do this. In your case, the efficiency does not matter, but what if the state you were trying to validate was a 100 field form with a very expensive render method. Now, on every key down you&#39;ve essentially doubled the amount of work that react has to do to render your components, causing them to first render without being validated, and then filtering and/or validating them for a very likely second render.\n\nAdditional Issues\n\nIn my case, i&#39;m working on a form and not a simple component like you described above. I may go with a mix of solution 3 and 5. Its more complicated then I want though. It involves using one function to filter, generate errors, and set the state for each field (ie. solution 3). And then on componenetDidUpdate I may look for state keys whose values are different from the last value that the field was validated with. The second step here has many ways of doing so, all of which are messy and inefficient. To make it worse, they practically never run under normal circumstances because I always use the first function to update and validate their state, so this makes testing it harder. It&#39;s like leaving some fallback in my app that seems to work but during the entire development process it never triggers except for like the one time that I decided to test it. Seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nThere are additional efficiency concerns I also won&#39;t get into which relates to trying not to re-validate a field if it has the same value it was validated with last time. This is a whole other can of worms, but basically what it boils down to is that you should be able to not only validate a state before render, but you should have access to the previous state as well, so you can save some cpu time and only validate the fields that changed. For example, if you have a very long textarea with some complex regex, it would be nice to not validate that on every component render even if its a separate field that is changing.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nI&#39;m very thoroughly disappointed that react seems to provide no legitimate option for this. Seeing as you can call setState many times in one operation, and each one will be queued, how is it that they don&#39;t provide us with one callback after all state changes are resolved and we&#39;re about to render? Well if you think about it, the render function itself is this callback, because I think its only ever called after setStates are resolved, but again, its evil to call setState on render, and it would be a million times cleaner to have render() simply receive the correct state, so I don&#39;t see how this is very useful.\n\nDoes anyone know why they decided to get rid of componentWillUpdate?\n",

            "body": "Short answer: Don&#39;t (re)build a parser in Node.js, use the browser instead\n\nI strongly advise against evaluating or parsing crawled data in Node.js if you are anyway using puppeteer for crawling. When you are using puppeteer you already have a browser with a great sandbox for JavaScript code running in another process. Why risk that kind of isolation and &quot;rebuild&quot; a parser in your Node.js script? If your Node.js script breaks, your whole script will fail. In the worst case, you might even expose your machine to serious risks when you try to run untrusted code inside your main thread.\n\nInstead, try to do as much parsing as possible inside the context of the page. You can even do an evil  call there. There worst that could happen? Your browser hangs or crashes.\n\nExample\n\nImagine the following HTML page (very much simplified). You are trying to read the text which is pushed into an array. The only information you have is that there is an additional attribute  which is set to .\n\n\n\nBad code\n\nHere is a simple example what your code might look like right now:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the script extracts the JavaScript code from the page. Now we have the JavaScript code from the page and we &quot;only&quot; need to parse it, right? Well, this is the wrong approach. Don&#39;t try to rebuild a parser inside Node.js. Just use the browser. There are basically two approaches you can take to do that in your case.\n\n\nInject proxy functions into the page and fake some built-in functions (recommended)\nParse the data on the client-side (!) by using , a regex or  (eval only if really necessary)\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Inject proxy functions into the page\n\nIn this approach you are replacing native browser functions with your own &quot;fake functions&quot;. Example:\n\n\n\nThis code replaces the original  function with our own function. Everything works as normal, but when an item with our target id is pushed into an array, a special condition is triggered. To inject this function into the page, you could use . To receive the data from Node.js you would have to expose a function to the browser via :\n\n\n\nNow it doesn&#39;t really matter how complex the code of the page is, whether it happens inside some asynchronous handler or whether the page changes the surrounding code. As long as the target data is pushing the data into an array, we will get it.\n\nYou can use this approach for a lot of crawling. Check how the data is processed and replace the low level functions processing the data with your own proxy version of it.\n\nOption 2: Parse the data\n\nLet&#39;s assume the first approach does not work for some reason. The data is in some script tag, but you are not able to get it by using fake functions.\n\nThen you should parse the data, but not inside your Node.js environment. Do it inside the page context. You could run a regular expression or use . But do it before returning the data back to Node.js. This approach has the benefit that if your code will crash your environment for some reason, it will not be your main script, but just your browser that crashes.\n\nTo give some example code. Instead of running the code from the original &quot;bad code&quot; sample, we change it to this:\n\n\n\nThis will only return the parts of the code we need, which can then be fruther processed from within Node.js.\n\n\n\nIndependent of which approach you choose, both ways are much better and more secure than running unknown code inside your main thread. If you absolutely have to process the data in your Node.js environment, use a regular expression for it like shown in the answer from trincot. You should never use eval to run untrusted code.\n",

The official &quot;If is Evil&quot; page shows essentially the following as a good way to do things:\n\n\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to these various approaches.  One big advantage to a regex is that you can capture parts of the match and use them to modify the response.  Of course, you can usually achieve similar results with the other approaches by either setting a variable in the original block or using .  The downside of the regex approach is that it can get unwieldy if you want to match a variety of locations, plus the low precedence of a regex might just not fit with how you want to match locations —&#160;not to mention that  there are apparently performance impacts from regexes in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of including files (as far as I can tell) is that it is a little more flexible about exactly what you can include —&#160;it doesn&#39;t have to be a full location block, for example.  But it&#39;s also just subjectively a bit clunkier than named locations.\n\nAlso note that there is a related solution that you may be able to use in similar situations: nested locations.  The idea is that you would start with a very general location, apply some configuration common to several of the possible matches, and then have separate nested locations for the different types of paths that you want to match.  For example, it might be useful to do something like this:\n\n\n",

Basically, catastrophic backtracking happens when a regex fails to match and different permutations of the same regex can find a partial match.  The regex engine then tries all those permutations.  If you want to go over your code and inspect your regexes these are the 3 key issues to look at:\n\n\nAlternatives must be mutually exclusive.  If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails.  If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.  A classic example is  to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a &quot;dot matches line breaks&quot; mode.  If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces (matched by both  and ) will break the regex.  The fix is to use  to make the alternatives mutually exclusive or even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as  for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.\nQuantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive what comes between them.  Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match.  A classic example is  to match 3 things with &quot;anything&quot; between them. When  can&#39;t be matched the first  will expand character by character until the end of the line or file.  For each expansion the second  will expand character by character to match the remainder of the line or file.  The fix is to realize that you can&#39;t have &quot;anything&quot; between them.  The first run needs to stop at  and the second run needs to stop at .  With single characters  is an easy solution.  Since we now stop at the delimiter, we can use possessive quantifiers to further increase performance.\nA group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it.  That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.  This is the problem illustrated in JDB&#39;s answer.\n\n\nWhile I was writing my answer I decided that this merited a full article on my website.  This is now online too.\n",

They have a sweet point (mainly simple assignment or builtin operations). But if the actor is any kind of non-trivial you&#39;ll see the complexity ramp up quickly, not just for the human but also for the compiler. This leads to\n\n\nslow compilation\nsub-optimal emitted code\nharder to maintain source\nnew classes of error (e.g. when the expression templates hold references to locals/temporaries, something that Boost Proto (and hence Phoenix) does not prevent or signal. In fact, it encourages it by assuming all template expressions are ephemeral, but I digress).\n\n\n\n  Interestingly: Spirit X3 dropped Phoenix altogether, even though Phoenix was once the brain child of Spirit&#179;.\n  \n  The new style uses c++14 polymorphic lambdas, that look 90% like the helper function object in the original code, but inline as a lambda.\n\n\nThis specific case\n\nCan&#39;t work. At all.\n\nThe problem is that you&#39;re mixing lazy/deferred actors with direct invocations. That can never work. The type of  isn&#39;t supposed to be . Of course. It is supposed to be a lazy actor&#185; that can be used at some later time to create a . \n\nNow that we know that (and why)  is an actor type, it should become clear why it is completely bogus to call  on it. You might as well say\n\n\n\nAnd wonder why it would not compile.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should probably just have the dedicated functor. You can of course Phoenix-adapt the regex functions you require, but all it does is shift the complexity tax for some syntactic sugar.\n\nI&#39;d always opt for the more naive approach that is going to be more understandable to a seasoned c++ programmer, and avoids pitfalls that come with high-wire acts&#178;.\n\nNevertheless, here&#39;s a pointer should you be curious:\n\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/phoenix/modules/function.html\n\nLive On Coliru\n\n\n\n\n\n&#185; think composed function object that can be invoked at a later time\n\n&#178; the balance might tip if you were designing this as an EDSL for further configuration by non-experts, but then you will have the added responsibility of documenting your EDSL and the constraints in which it can be used\n\n&#179; should we say, spirit-child of a brain?\n",

This is flip-flop mode.\n\n triggers flip-flop mode; , , and  don&#39;t.\nThis optimization can&#39;t be applied to &quot;star&quot; nodes like  because they can match zero characters, so a failure at one point in a sequence isn&#39;t indicative of failure later in the same sequence.\n\nYou can see this in the debug output for each regex.

Both  (logically equivalent to ) and  (logically equivalent to ) probably could be optimized, though; it might make sense to ask on perl5-porters whether either would be worth the effort.\n\nIn case you&#39;re interested, &quot;flip-flop mode&quot; is enabled by setting the  flag on a regex when it&#39;s compiled.

(PCRE, which powers Regex101, is smarter than most, but other regex/string combinations can cause catastrophic backtracking.)\n\nWithout needing to know much about Big O, I can tell that combinatorial things are exponential, while searching is linear. So why don&#39;t regex engines ensure the string contains required characters (so they can quit early)?\n\nUnfortunately, most of what I&#39;ve read about catastrophic backtracking puts the blame on the regex writer for writing evil regexes, instead of exploring the possibility that regex engines/compilers need to do better. Although I found several sources that look at regex engines/compilers, they are too technical.\n\n\n\nComing back after getting more experience, I know that regexes are declarative, meaning the execution plan is determined by the computer, not the programmer. Optimization is one of the ways that regex engines differ the most.\n\nWhile PCRE and Perl have challenged the declarative status-quo with the introduction of backtracking control verbs, it is other engines, without the verbs, which are most likely to catastrophically backtrack.\n",

            "body": "The worst input for a regular expression will vary from engine to engine. The same regex and string may take no time at all on one engine, but never finish on another.\n\nDifferences between engines\n\nEngine Type\n\nFor certain engines, the &quot;evilest&quot; regex is still benign, running in linear time (or  time when both the length of the regex and the length of the string may vary.) Of course, the reason for this is the implementation. These engines don&#39;t backtrack; instead they use a finite state machine (FSM).\n\nNote that some backtracking implementations use FSM, but only as an intermediate step. Don&#39;t let this confuse you; they&#39;re not FSM.\n\nMost of the old regex engines (like sed) use FSM matching. There are a few new engines that use this implementation, such as Go. PCRE even has DFA functions (search for &quot;DFA&quot; here) that use this type of matching.\n\nAnother answer of mine also addresses the potential speed difference between the two implementations.\n\nIt would be wise to consider using a FSM implementation if you are really worried about malicious input affecting the speed of your regex. Unfortunately, FSM is not as powerful as the other implementation; it lacks support for some features, such as back references.\n\nOptimizations\n\nEvil is actually a bit subjective. Something evil to one regex engine may not be evil to a different engine. An evil plot can be thwarted if the engine is optimized. Optimizations are particularly important to backtracking engines, given their potential exponential run time.\n\nShort-circuiting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the engine may be able to quickly determine a match is impossible. While running the regex  against the string , Regex101 says:\n\n\n  Your match failed outright. What this means is the engine, due to its internal optimizations, understood that your pattern would never match at any position, and thus did not even attempt to.\n\n\nKeep in mind that Wikipedia says the regex is evil, especially when paired with that string.\n\nOf course, the engine is smart to not need to backtrack to determine the match wouldn&#39;t work. It saw something pretty obvious: the regex needs an  in order to match, but no  was present in the string.\n\nModifiers\n\nI mention this because you might not expect modifiers to be a factor in regex performance. But they are.\n\nEven PCRE, one of the more optimized implementations, may take considerably more steps with both the  and  modifiers enabled. See my question here for more information about this. In the end, I figured out that only certain characters trigger this behavior.\n\nAnalyzing Strings\n\nString length\n\nIn general, a long string will be slower than a short string. In fact, if you find a string of length x that causes catastrophic backtracking, you can make it backtrack a bit more by increasing the length of the string.\n\nGreedy vs. Lazy\n\nCompare the speeds of these regexes:\n\n\n  on \n on \n  on \n on \n\n\nEssentially, greedy matching is best when you think you will need to match a lot. Lazy matching is best when you need to match only a little.\n\nNote that if you change the regex to  or , then the engine may optimize things considerably.\n\nBrute force testing\n\nThere are several frameworks that are specifically designed to try to find vulnerabilities in your regexes. It may be worthwhile to try one out.\n\nThere&#39;s really one thing that I will suggest if you wanted to try making your own algorithm. It&#39;s not practical to try all characters in the dictionary, especially if you want to test long strings.\n\nInstead, look at your regex to determine what characters you should test. If you have  as your regex, there are really only two things that go into the match:  and not . You could really just imagine that there are only two characters:  and  (aka not ) when you generate your strings to brute force with.\n\nSetting timeouts\n\nIt would be fantastic to be able to ensure your regex finishes before the heat death of the universe, right? Some regex engines do have a way to set a time out.\n\n.NET:\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\n\n  \n  \n  Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it exists, the  value defined in the .\n  \n  When called,  restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script execution a call such as  is made, the script will run for a total of 45 seconds before timing out.\n\n\nPerl\n\nYou might as well visit the link, since it&#39;s right on Stack Overflow.\n",

            "body": "TL;DR\n\nIn short, &quot;backtracking&quot; is when a regex engine returns to a &quot;flexible&quot; match, attempting a different path to get a successful match.\n\nBacktracking with Alternation\n\nFor example, in the following pattern and input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regex engine will match &quot;foo&quot;, then attempt the first of the two options, matching &quot;b&quot; and then &quot;a&quot;, but fails at &quot;r&quot;. Rather than failing the whole match, though, it will &quot;rewind the tape&quot; and start with the second alternative, matching &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; and then &quot;z&quot;... success!\n\nBacktracking with Quantifiers\n\nThis also works with quantifiers. A quantifier is anything that encourages the engine to match a repeating pattern, including , ,  and  (depending on the engine).\n\nA greedy quantifier (the default) will match as many repetitions as possible before moving on to the rest of the pattern. For example, given the pattern and input below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern  will begin by matching the entire string: &quot;foobar&quot;. However, when it moves on to the , the regex engine has reach the end of the input and the match fails. Rather than simply giving up, the engine will ask the last greedy quantifier to give up one of its repetitions, now matching &quot;fooba&quot;. The match still fails, so the engine asks  to give up the &quot;a&quot; (failure), and then the &quot;b&quot;. After giving up the &quot;b&quot;, the engine can now match , and the match succeeds.\n\nTrees and Backtracking\n\nAnother way of thinking of a regex is as a &quot;tree&quot;, and backtracking is going back up a node and trying another path. Given the pattern  and the input &quot;foobaz&quot;, the engine will attempt something like the following:\n\n\n\nCounting the &quot;Backtracks&quot;\n\nAs to why you see differences in the &quot;number&quot; of backtracks... this probably has a lot to do with internal optimizations and logging level. For example, RegexBuddy does not appear to be logging the match to the empty string before , while regex101 does. In the end, though, it doesn&#39;t really matter what exact order you backtrack in (what order you climb back up the tree) so long as you end up with the same result.\n\nEvil Regexes\n\nYou already know this, but for the benefit of anyone else who happens by, your regex was written to demonstrate &quot;catastrophic backtracking&quot; (aka &quot;evil regex&quot;), where the number of backtrack attempts grows exponentially as the length of the input increases. These regexes can be exploited to perform DoS attacks, so you must use caution not to introduce these into your patterns (as I found out).\n",

            "body": "Why you shouldn&#39;t and when you should use regular expressions?\n\nFirst off, a common misnomer: Regexps are not for &quot;parsing&quot; HTML. Regexes can however &quot;extract&quot; data. Extracting is what they&#39;re made for. The major drawback of regex HTML extraction over proper SGML toolkits or baseline XML parsers are their syntactic effort and varying reliability.\n\nConsider that making a somewhat dependable HTML extraction regex:\n\n\n\nis way less readable than a simple phpQuery or QueryPath equivalent:\n\n\n\nThere are however specific use cases where they can help.\n\n\nMany DOM traversal frontends don&#39;t reveal HTML comments , which however are sometimes the more useful anchors for extraction. In particular pseudo-HTML variations  or SGML residues are easy to tame with regexps.\nOftentimes regular expressions can save post-processing. However HTML entities often require manual caretaking.\nAnd lastly, for extremely simple tasks like extracting &lt;img src= urls, they are in fact a probable tool. The speed advantage over SGML/XML parsers mostly just comes to play for these very basic extraction procedures.\n\n\nIt&#39;s sometimes even advisable to pre-extract a snippet of HTML using regular expressions  and process the remainder using the simpler HTML parser frontends.\n\nNote: I actually have this app, where I employ XML parsing and regular expressions alternatively. Just last week the PyQuery parsing broke, and the regex still worked. Yes weird, and I can&#39;t explain it myself. But so it happened.\nSo please don&#39;t vote real-world considerations down, just because it doesn&#39;t match the regex=evil meme. But let&#39;s also not vote this up too much.

To match  or  , we form the regex  .\n  As before, Perl will try to match the regex at the earliest possible\n  point in the string. At each character position, Perl will first try\n  to match the first alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match, Perl will\n  then try the next alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match either, then\n  the match fails and Perl moves to the next position in the string.\n  Some examples:\n\n\n  \n  Even though  is the first alternative in the second regex,  is able to match\n  earlier in the string.\n\n\n  \n  Here, all the alternatives match at the first string position, so the\n  first alternative is the one that matches. If some of the alternatives\n  are truncations of the others, put the longest ones first to give them\n  a chance to match.\n\n\n  \n  The last example points out \n  that character classes are like alternations of characters. At a given\n  character position, the first alternative that allows the regexp match\n  to succeed will be the one that matches.\n\n\nSo this should explain the price you pay when using alternations in regex.\n\nWhen putting simple regex together, you don&#39;t pay such a price. It&#39;s well explained in another related question in SO. When directly searching for a constant string, or a set of characters as in the question, optimizations can be done and no backtracking is needed which means potentially faster code.\n\nWhen defining the regex alternations, just choosing a good order (putting the most common findings first) can influence the performance. It is not the same either to choose between two options, or twenty. As always, premature optimization is the root of all evil and you should instrumentiate you code (Devel::NYTProf) if there are problems or you want improvements. But as a general rule alternations should be kept to a minimum and avoided if possible since:\n\n\nThey easily make the regex too big an complex. We like simple, easy to understand / debug / maintain regex.\nVariability and input dependant. They could be an unexpected source of problems since they backtrack and can lead to unexpected lack of performance depending on your input. As I understand, there&#39;s no case when they will be faster.\nConceptually you are trying to match two different things, so we could argue that two different statements are more correct and clear than just one.\n\n\nHope this answer gets closer to what you were expecting.\n",

First, the code:\n\n\n\nThe idea for this program is that the user enters an URL from Amazon or other sites like that and the program retrieves the image of the object, the sell price and (eventually) shipping fees. This is done by creating a sort of simple database ( will populate the list self.contenuti with some dictionaries containing the data). Now,  has to beahave exactly the same, no matter the site, and this is accomplished by creating specific classes (like the class ) that will have the specific functions for retrieving the data (every site has is own structure, so I can&#39;t use the same regex) and simply putting them in the dictionary : whenever  is called, the appropriate class (here I have only ) will be called passing  as an argument, and this will be the content of the site provided, converted into str, so the class Amazon can search the appropriate informations via regex.\n\nThis is for home uses, I already created a similar program that, with the data collected, writes a simple HTML file that is a sort of image gallery of all the objects of interest. What I want to do here, with , is downloading the image so it will be displayed into a tkinter label when I will write the GUI. No HTML file needed, the whole thing will be GUI based, like a sort of database.\n\nThe problem is that, whatever URL I provide (here I&#39;m doing it in the  function, for debug purposes) I get this evil and nasty &quot;thing&quot;: \n\n\n\nFrom what I understand, the problem is in urllib: for some reason the URL is not parsed correctly and I end up with the error. So, I tried to write this:\n\n\n\nThis is wrote in another module, for testing purpose, there is only this piece of code. If I have it for its own, it works perfectly, with no error. I tried with other URLs, same thing: if I try the second piece of code, no errors; if I try to pass it to , I got the error. What is going on?\n",

By script related attributes I mean any attribute that starts with on. \n\n\n\nMy first thought was to use BeautifulSoup to remove the tags and attributes. Unfortunately, I am unable to use BeautifulSoup. Seeing that BeautifulSoup is off the table I can see two options for doing this. The first option I see is splitting the strings and parsing based on index. This seems like a bad solution to me.\n\nThe other option is to use Regular Expressions. However, we know that isn&#39;t a good solution either (Cthulhu Parsing).\n\nNow with that in mind, I personally feel it is alright to use regular expressions to strip the attributes. After all, with those it is still simple string manipulation. \n\nSo for removing the attributes I have:\n\n\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I personally think the above perfectly acceptable use of Regular Expression with HTML. But still I would like to get some opinions on the above usage. \n\nThen there is the question of the script tags. I&#39;m very tempted to go with Regular Expressions for this because I know them and I know what I need is pretty simple. Something like:\n\n\n\nThe above would start to get me close to what I need. And yes I realize the above RegEx will grab everything starting at the first opening script tag until the last closing script tag, but it&#39;s a starting example. \n\nI&#39;m very tempted to use Regular Expressions as I&#39;m familiar with them (more so than Python) and I know that is the quickest way to achieve the results I want, at least for me it is. \n\nSo I need help to go against my nature and not be evil. I want to be evil and use RegEx so somebody please show me the light and guide me to the promised land on non-Regular Expressions.\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt looks like I wasn&#39;t very clear about what my question actually is, I apologize for that. My question is how can I parse the HTML using pure Python without Regular Expressions? \n\n\n\nAs for the above code example, it&#39;s wrong. I know it is wrong, I was using it as an example of a starting point. \n\nI hope this clears up my question some\n\nUpdate 2\n\nI just wanted to add a few more notes about what I am  doing. \n\nI am crawling a web site to get the data I need.\n\nOnce we have the page that contains the data we need it is saved to the database.\n\nThen the saved web page is displayed to the user.\n\nThe issue I am trying to solve happens here. The application throws a script error when you attempt to interact with the page that forces the user to click on a confirmation box. The application is not a web browser but uses the web browser DLL in Windows (I cannot remember the name at the moment).\n\nThe error in question only happens in this one page for this one web site.\n\nUpdate 3\n\nAfter adding the update I realized I was over thinking the problem, I was looking for a more generic solution. However, in this case that isn&#39;t what is needed. \n\nThe page is dynamically generated, however the script tags will stay static. With that in mind the solution becomes much simpler. With that I no longer need to treat it like HTML but as static strings.\n\nSo the solution I&#39;m looking at is\n\n\n\nI would like to avoid Regular Expression however, since I&#39;m limited to only using the standard library regular expressions seems like the best solution in this case.

            "body": "Eval is Evil\nFirst of all: don&#39;t use   unless there is a good reason. And there is never a good reason.\nin the worst case  makes your application vulnerable to injection attacks and also it&#39;s very slow. A bit of research reveals plenty of reasons why eval is a big no-no.\nDon&#39;t save your calculation code into the database\nIf you do so and you would like to switch from PHP to another language you would still have PHP code in your database. It makes it really hard to migrate languages. You should always strive to make as many parts of your application as independent as possible.\nIn this case you would tight-couple the language you use, to the database. That&#39;s a bad practice.\nAlso the only possibilities to run your calculations from the database would be to eval them (which is bad, see above) or to disassemble the string with string operations or regex which causes unnecessary effort.\nIt&#39;s all about Strategy\nIn order to solve your problem you must execute code dependent of which calculation you need. That could be either done with switch-case-statements or if-statements. But that&#39;s also not a very elegant solution. Imagine you would need to execute other operations before calculating in the future, or extend functionality. You would need to update all your cases or if-statements.\nThere is a nice design-pattern which is called Strategy Pattern. The strategy pattern solves problems when one use-case can be handled differently which is probably what you want.\nYou want to calculate something (use-case) and there are different calculation types for it (different strategies)\nHow it works\nTo implement the Strategy pattern you basically need three things.\n\nA class where you inject your strategies. It&#39;s basically a wrapper for your strategy tasks.\nAn interface which will be implemented by your strategies\nYour strategies\n\nYour interface could look like this:\n\nThe interface will make sure that all your strategies provide a method to actually run the calculation. Nothing special.\nNext you may want to have a base class that takes your calculation operators as constructor arguments and stores them into properties.\n\nNow it&#39;s getting serious. We are implementing our strategies.\n\nOf course you could clean this one up a bit, but what I want to point out here is the class declaration.\nWe are extending our  class so that we can pass the arithmetic operations via constructor and we are implementing the  which tells our class: &quot;Hey! You must provide a calculate method, I don&#39;t care whether you want or not.\nWe&#39;ll see later why this is an integral part of the pattern.\nSo we have two concrete classes that contain the actual code for the actual arithmetic operation. If you would ever need to, you could change it easily as you see.\nTo add more operations just add another class.\nNow we will create a class where our strategies can be injected. Later you will instantiate an object of this class and work with it.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\nThe most important part here is the constructor. See how we type-hint our interface here. By doing that we make sure that only an object can be injected (Dependency Injection) whose class implements the interface. We do not need to demand a concrete class here. That&#39;s the crucial point here.\nAlso there&#39;s a calculate method in there. It&#39;s just a wrapper for our strategy to execute it&#39;s calculate method.\nWrapping it up\nSo now we just need to create an object of our  class and pass an object of one of our strategy classes (that contain the code for the arithmetic operations).\n\nTry replacing the string stored in  to  and you see that the operation for calculating the percentage will be executed.\nConclusion\nThe strategy pattern allowed you to create a clean interface for working with dynamic tasks that are only made concrete during runtime. Neither your database needs to know how we calculate things, nor your actual calculator does. The only thing we need to make sure is to code against an interface that provides a method to let us calculate things.\n",

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nBy sending headers inadvertently, you might have introduced a security vulnerability: say, you are doing a redirection, but hence the headers are already sent, the redirection does not work and the rest of the page might be output, thus the visitor may see what she was not supposed to see. While this can be mitigated by using exit, you know the story, only if every one of us utilize good programming habits every time.\nEven if letting the visitor stay in the wrong page does not have a security implication, by breaking a session behavior, or in some other ways I&#39;ve encountered over years, the security and/or session cycle might have taken some sort of blow in the end.\nIf not security, you may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after ?&gt;. An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

In theory, it&#39;s still possible to match the regex without killing the stack, but I doubt whether the regex library you&#39;re using is clever enough to make that optimization.\n\nYou can fix the regex to match what you want it to match by making the data part () non-greedy: change it to .

But I don&#39;t know if it will work in general; I really don&#39;t know anything about the MS implementation.\n\nIn my opinion, you should avoid back references, even though it means complicating your code a bit. What I would do is to first match:\n\n\n\nand then create the terminating string:\n\n\n\nand then  the terminating string. That means you can no longer use the regex library&#39;s iterator, which is unfortunate, but the loop is still pretty straight-forward.\n\nBy the way, I find it odd that you only recognize the start delimiter if it is at the end of a line, and the end delimiter if it is at the start of a line.

This is a special case of .  denote atomic groups. , ,  and  denote lookaround.  denote comments.\n\nRuby regexp engine supports comments in regexes. Considering them in the main regex would be very difficult. We can try to strip them if we really want to support these, but supporting them fully will get messy due to the possibility of inline flags turning extended mode (and thus line comments) on and off in ways that a regular expression cannot capture. I will go ahead and not support unescaped parentheses in regex comments[3].\n\nWe want to count:\n\n\nthe number of left parentheses \nthat are not escaped by a backslash  (read: not preceded by an odd number of backslashes that are not preceded by yet another backslash) and \nthat are not followed by a question mark \n\n\nRuby doesn&#39;t support unbounded lookbehind, but if we reverse the source first, we can rewrite the first assertion slightly: . The second assertion becomes a lookbehind: . \n\nthe whole solution\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: we can show the NP-hardness by converting the satisfiability problem to it:\n\n\nAND:  ( must be an assertion)\nOR: \nNOT: \natoms: , , , ..., , ...\n\n\nexample(XOR): \n\nthis extends to NP-completeness for any class of regexes that can be tested in polynomial time. This includes any regex with no nested repetition (or repeated backreferences to repetition or recursion) and with bounded nesting depth of optional matches.\n\n[2]:  returns , indicating that unnamed capturing groups are ignored when named capturing groups are present. Tested in Ruby 1.9.3\n\n[3]: Inline comments start with  and end with . They cannot contain an unescaped right parenthesis, but they can contain an unescaped left parenthesis. These can be stripped easily (even though we have to sprinkle the &quot;unescaped&quot; regex everywhere), are the lesser evil, but they&#39;re also less likely to contain anunescaped left parenthesis.\n\nLine comments start with  and end with a newline. These are only treated as comments in the extended mode. Outside the extended mode, they match the literal  and newline. This is still easy, even if we have to consider escaping again. Determining if the regex has the extended flag set is not too difficult, but the flag modifier groups are a different beast entirely.\n\nEven with Ruby&#39;s awesome recursive regexes, merely determining if a previously-open group modifying the extended mode is already closed would yield a very nasty regex (even if you replace one by one and don&#39;t have to skip comments, you have to account for escaping). It wouldn&#39;t be pretty (even with interpolation) and it wouldn&#39;t be fast. \n",

The  value may contain any number of values, but one of them must be exactly: . The Anchor tag names and the CLASS attribute name are matched case insensitively.\n\nExample input ():\n\n\n\nExample output ():\n\n\n\nThe reader wishing to advanced their regex-fu would do well to study this (rather long and complex) regex. It is carefully handcrafted for both accuracy and speed and implements several advanced efficiency techniques. It is, of course, fully commented to allow readability by mere humans. This example clearly demonstrates that &quot;REGULAR EXPRESSIONS&quot; have evolved into a rich,  (non-REGULAR) programming language. \n\nNote that there will always be edge cases where this solution will fail. e.g. Evil strings within CDATA sections, comments, scripts, styles and tag attribute values can trip this up.

            "body": "UPDATE\n\nSo I am still messing with this, and have gotten as far as finding all the instances of tags, though I&#39;d rather JUST find the deepest stacked instance, as life would be easier that way.. Anyway here is what I got..\n\n\n\nAre there ANY regexp guru&#39;s out there that could give me some pointers or a regexp that mimics what I need? Which is only getting the deepest stacked instance of a {{tag}} that ends like this {{//tag}}\n\nORIGINAL\n\nOk, so I have an issue I have seen others have, but with a different approach to it.. Or so I thought.. So I am curious if anyone else can help me solve this issue further..\n\nI have a database full of templates that I need to work with in PHP, these templates are made and used by another system, and so there for can not be changed. With that said, these templates have hierarchy style tags added to them. What I need to do, is get these templates from the database, and then programmatically find these tags, their function name (or tag name), and their inner contents, as well as anything following the function (tag) name within the brackets.. An example of one of these tags is, {{FunctionName some (otherStuff) !Here}} Some content sits inside and it ends {{/FunctionName}}\n\nThis is where it gets more fun, the templates have another random tag, which I am guessing are the &quot;variable&quot; style of these tags, as they are always generally the same syntax. Which looks like this, ${RandomTag}, but also there are times that the function style one is there but without an ending tag, like so.. {{RandomLoner}}\n\nExample Template...\n\n\n\nOk so in no way is this a real template, but it follows all the rules that I have seen thus far.\n\nNow I have tried different things with regex and preg_match_all to pull out the matches, and get each of these into a nice array. So far what I have got is this (used it on the example template to make sure its working still)\n\n\n\nI have tried a couple approaches, (that took me nearly 8 hours to get to)\n\n\n\nIn no way am I a guru with regexp, I actually just learned it over the last day or so, trying to get this to work. I have googled for this, and realize that regexp is not designed for nested stuff, but the (?R) seems to do the trick on simple bracket examples Ive seen on the internets, but they always only take into account of the stuff between the { and } or ( and ) or &lt; and &gt;. After reading nearly the whole regex info website, and playing, I came up with these 2 versions.\n\nSo what I NEED to do (I think), would have a regexp work from the DEEPEST hierarchy tag first, and work its way out (if I can do that with help from php, thats fine with me). I was thinking finding the Deepest layer, get its data, and work backwards til all the contents are in 1 fat array. I assumed that was what the ($R) was going to do for me, but it didn&#39;t.\n\nSo any help on what I am missing would be great, also take into note that mine seems to have issues with {{}} that DONT have an ending version of it. So like my {{Random}} example, was removed for the sake of me parsing the array example. I feel these tags, along with the ${} tags can be left alone (if I knew how to do that with regexp), and just remain in the text where they are. I am more or less interested in the functions and getting their data into a multidimensional array for me to work with further.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just have been banging me head all night with this. I started with the assumption that it was going to be a bit easier.. Til I realized the tags where nested :/\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thanks!\n",

Now... I haven&#39;t ever benchmarked &quot;small&quot; regexes so I don&#39;t know their speed. They surely are compact to write.\n\nAh I was forgetting, regexes are The Evil. Their main problem is that they are like an hammer and when you have them, you try to make all the problems be like a nail. So their main problem is in the user (the programmer).\n\nFirst &quot;big&quot; limitation: Javascript implements only a subset of them, with no Unicode support. Normally the language you use server side has a more complete implementation, so you get limited by js. Even quite complete implementations like the .NET one have big limits: no support for surrogate pairs and no support for &quot;composed&quot; characters (characters that use combining mark). But, as always, the problem is in the programmer. How many programmers that know Unicode know the intricacies of Unicode, of the various sets of digits, of the diacritics?\n\nSecond &quot;big&quot; limitation: maintainability. They are complex and unreadable when they are written. But months later? They get worse! And if you have to train a new programmer, now he has to learn one more language: regex.\n\nThird &quot;big&quot; limitation: they hide too much. You see . What does it means? a digit a space and a digit? Surely. But both  and  in the .NET Regexes &quot;hide&quot; a microworld.  &quot;matches&quot; any non-european digit (and there are many many ones in Unicode).  &quot;matches&quot; so many esoteric spaces of which I don&#39;t even know the name... I don&#39;t even want to think about it. They are like icebergs. Only 1/8 is out of the water, while 7/8 is hidden. But it&#39;s that 7/8 that will probably kill you.\n",

This CAN be accomplished in Java as well without losing type-safety and the good stuff statically-typed languages provide WITHOUT the nasty side-effects of some of the other languages that do evil things with dynamic casting. A Perl example that does some questionable math:\n\n\n\nIn Java, this is better accomplished (IMHO) by using a method I call &quot;cross-casting&quot;.\nWith cross-casting, reflection is used in a lazy-loaded cache of constructors and methods that are dynamically discovered via the following static method: \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, no built-in Java methods such as Class.cast() will do this for String to BigDecimal or String to Integer or any other conversion where there is no supporting class hierarchy. For my part, the point is to provide a fully dynamic way to achieve this - for which I don&#39;t think the prior reference is the right approach - having to code every conversion. Simply put, the implementation is just to cast-from-string if it is legal/possible.\n\nSo the solution is simple reflection looking for public Members of either:\n\nSTRING_CLASS_ARRAY = (new Class[] {String.class});\n\na) Member member = targetClass.getMethod(method.getName(),STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\nb) Member member = targetClass.getConstructor(STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\n\nYou will find that all of the primitives (Integer, Long, etc) and all of the basics (BigInteger, BigDecimal, etc) and even java.regex.Pattern are all covered via this approach. I have used this with significant success on production projects where there are a huge amount of arbitrary String value inputs where some more strict checking was needed. In this approach, if there is no method or when the method is invoked an exception is thrown (because it is an illegal value such as a non-numeric input to a BigDecimal or illegal RegEx for a Pattern), that provides the checking specific to the target class inherent logic.\n\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\n1) You need to understand reflection well (this is a little complicated and not for novices).\n2) Some of the Java classes and indeed 3rd-party libraries are (surprise) not coded properly. That is, there are methods that take a single string argument as input and return an instance of the target class but it isn&#39;t what you think... Consider the Integer class:\n\n\n\nThe above method really has nothing to do with Integers as objects wrapping primitives ints.\nReflection will find this as a possible candidate for creating an Integer from a String incorrectly versus the decode, valueof and constructor Members - which are all suitable for most arbitrary String conversions where you really don&#39;t have control over your input data but just want to know if it is possible an Integer.\n\nTo remedy the above, looking for methods that throw Exceptions is a good start because invalid input values that create instances of such objects should throw an Exception. Unfortunately, implementations vary as to whether the Exceptions are declared as checked or not. Integer.valueOf(String) throws a checked NumberFormatException for example, but Pattern.compile() exceptions are not found during reflection lookups. Again, not a failing of this dynamic &quot;cross-casting&quot; approach I think so much as a very non-standard implementation for exception declarations in object creation methods.\n\nIf anyone would like more details on how the above was implemented, let me know but I think this solution is much more flexible/extensible and with less code without losing the good parts of type-safety. Of course it is always best to &quot;know thy data&quot; but as many of us find, we are sometimes only recipients of unmanaged content and have to do the best we can to use it properly.\n\nCheers.\n",

For example, a smiley like ;) turns into a WINK icon, matching against \n\n\n\nand works in most cases.

I also realized there&#39;d still be problems with other legitimate matches, such as EVIL: .\n\nSo what it appears I really need is the negation of preceding html entities missing a semicolon:\n\n\n\nBut it is still matching and I&#39;m not sure why.\n\nIt would be ideal to still get returned matches that can be replaced wholesale without further inspection, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.  What is not suitable is first parsing out the html entities, because sometimes they&#39;re necessary and/or part of a legitimate smiley (as with EVIL).\n\n\n\nEDIT (some Google food):\n\nI discovered (and Bryan also noted below) that Zero-width positive lookbehind, , would work as desired (not Zero-width negative lookahead ).\n\nAs per regular-expressions.info, the latter &quot;will only succeed if the regex inside the lookahead fails to match&quot; which sounds right, but isn&#39;t when the section is optional anyway.\n\nIn contrast, the former &quot;matches at a position if the pattern inside the lookahead can be matched ending at that position&quot; which isn&#39;t at all clear, but does the trick.  Because the match is using lookbehind, there&#39;s no chance of backtracking to satisfy the latter portion of the regex.\n\nSo a full regex looks like:\n\n\n\nand that matches these:    while failing this:  \nIt does however still match , so more tweaking would be ideal (such as additionally matching semicolons in place of the ampersands, if that doesn&#39;t cause other smileys with entities in them to break).  People typing out html entities in chat isn&#39;t likely to come up much anyway.\n\nEither way would be &quot;good enough&quot;--except that javascript doesn&#39;t support negative lookbehind.

We Python users have trancended mere text manipulation!&quot; but no one is explaining why you&#39;re experiencing this problem.\n\nYour regex is working. It takes any alphabet, whitespace, or hyphen character and turns it into the number . The problem is that it thinks the negative sign in  is &quot;evil text&quot; to turn into a number.\n\nOne way to approach this is to provide an anchor for your regex - Make it match the commas (or beginning/ending of the string) surrounding the text. So it would see  and turn it into  but would see  and know that it&#39;s not text.\n\nAnother approach is to filter based on &quot;does it not contain digits&quot; instead of &quot;does it contain these things I need&quot; - because what if, later, you need to filter out other punctuation marks? Using  would match &quot;things that aren&#39;t digits or commas&quot;, which would turn  into  but keep  the same.\n\nA third approach is to split the string on commas, then test and change each individual segment - probably to see if it contains digits - and then join them back together.\n\nIf you choose the first or second approaches, I leave it up to you to write a regex that either matches a leading comma or the beginning of a string (and a trailing comma or the end of the string - both are similar). It&#39;s not terribly difficult.\n",

If that&#39;s still the case, here&#39;s what you want:\n\n\n\nAs of right now, I think these are the only regexes posted that allow for less than one letter with the first pattern, and less than two letters with the second pattern.\n\nRegexes are not a &quot;bad&quot; thing, they&#39;re just a specialized tool that isn&#39;t suited for every task. If you&#39;re trying to validate input in ASP.NET, I would definitely use a RegularExpressionValidator for this particular pattern, because otherwise you&#39;ll have to waste your time writing a CustomValidator for a pretty meager performance boost. See my answer to this other question for a little guidance on when and when not to use regex. \n\nIn this case, the reason I&#39;d use a regex validator has less to do with the pattern itself and more to do with ASP.NET. A RegularExpressionValidator can just be dragged and dropped into your ASPX code, and all you&#39;d have to write would be 10-21 characters of regex. With a CustomValidator, you&#39;d have to write custom validation functions, both in the codebehind and the JavaScript. You might squeeze a little more performance out of it, but think about when validation comes into play: only once per postback. The performance difference is going to be less than a millisecond.

This would require client and server coding each time I needed to use a validator.\n\n3) Use jQuery (or any other javascript framework) validation for client validation, then if they somehow get by that, have server-code validation controls for full postback. This would require all of the validation rules to be written in javascript as well as C#. I don&#39;t care about the full failed postback at this point, because the javascript validation would catch real users who weren&#39;t trying to screw me over.\n\nIs there alternative out there for using real CustomValidator controls, with partial postback, C# code only, for validating input without UpdatePanels and without a lot of redundant javascript?\n\nThanks\n",

            "body": "Overview\n\nAround the end of 2009, I wrote a simple templating system for PHP/HTML to be used in-house by our designers for brochure-ware type websites. The goal of the system is to allow templating in otherwise pure HTML via custom tags that are processed by PHP. For example, a templated page might look like this:\n\n\n\nThe template itself might look something like this:\n\n\n\nBesides the Page and Content/Container tags, there are a few other tags included in the core for stuff like flow control, iterating over a collection, outputting dynamic values, etc. The framework is designed so it&#39;s very easy to add your own set of tags registered under another prefix and namespace.\n\nCustom Tags to PHP\n\nHow do we parse these custom tags? Since the&#39;re no guarantee that the HTML file is well-formed XML, solutions like XSLT/XPATH won&#39;t be reliable. Instead, we use a regex to look for tags with registered prefixes, and replace those with PHP code. The PHP code is a stack-based design... upon encountering an opening tag, an object representing the tag is created pushed onto the stack, and its &quot;initialization function&quot; (if any) runs. Whenever a registered closing tag is encountered, the most recent object is popped off the stack, and its &quot;rendering function&quot; runs.\n\nSo, after the framework replaces the templating tags with PHP, our example page might look something like this (in realty it&#39;s a bit uglier):\n\n\n\nThe good, the bad, and \n\nNow, how to execute our newly-generated PHP code? I can think of a few options here. The easiest is to simply  the string, and that works well enough. However, any programmer will tell you &quot;eval is evil, don&#39;t use it...&quot; so the question is, is there anything more appropriate than  that we can use here? \n\nI&#39;ve considered using a temporary or cached file, using  output streams, etc, but as far as I can see these don&#39;t offer any real advantage over . Caching could speed things up, but in practice all the sites we have on this thing are already blazingly fast, so I see no need to make speed optimizations at this point.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor each of the things on this list: is it a good idea? Can you think of a better alternative?\n\n\nthe whole idea in general (custom tags for html / php)\nconverting tags to php code instead of processing directly\nthe stack-based approach \nthe use of  (or similar)\n\n\nThanks for reading and TIA for any advice. :)\n",

You could name each entry in the file and load them all into a hash table for easy access from your code.\n\nSecond choice, create a file that will be pre-processed into a java interface; it could escape the regex as it does so.  Personally I hate code generation, but if the java file is 100% never human edited, it&#39;s not too bad (the real evil is generated files that you are expected to edit!)\n\nThird (tricky and probably a bad idea): You might be able to create a custom doclet that will extract strings from your comments into a text file or a header file at compile time, then use one of the other two methods above.  This keeps your strings in the same file in which they are being used.  This could be really hard to do correctly, and the penalties of failure are extreme, so I wouldn&#39;t even consider it unless I had an overwhelming need and some pretty impressive talent.\n\nI only suggest this because comments are free-form and things within a &quot;pre&quot; tag are pretty safe from formatters and other system uglies.  The doclet could extract this before printing the javadocs, and could even add some of the generated javadocs indicating your use of regex strings.\n\nBefore downvoting and telling me this is a stupid idea--I KNOW, I just thought I&#39;d suggest it because it&#39;s interesting, but my preference as I stated above is a simple text file...\n",

If that doesn&#39;t,\nREMOVE THE BINARY because the program is badly behaved.\nAs a general principle we don&#39;t use Unix Railgun to trim the hedges.  https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#kill\nExplanation of above command:\n produces a list of process id&#39;s on the computer visible to this user.  The pipe grep filters that down for rows containing that string.  The  says don&#39;t match on the process itself doing the grepping.  The pipe awk print says split the rows on default delimiter whitespace and filter to the second column which is our process id.  The pipe xargs spins up a new process to send all those pid&#39;s to , ending them all.\nWhy  is bad, dangerous, ugly and hackish:\n\nThere&#39;s a small possibility that you will accidentally end the operating system or cause undefined behavior in an unrelated process, leading to whole system instability because  lists thousands of processes, and you can&#39;t be sure some 3rd party process shares your process name, or that in the time between read and execute kill -9, the processid had changed to something else, and now you&#39;ve ended some random necessary process unrelated to yours.\n\nIf the code being force-ended is doing any database ops or secure transactions with low probability race conditions, some fraction of a percent of the time, atomicity of that transaction will be wrecked, producing undefined behavior.  kill -9 takes no prisoners.  If your code is sensitive to this, try replacing the  part with a transmitted flag that requests a graceful shutdown, and only if that request is denied, last-resort to \n\n\nBut, if you understand all the risks and control for them with unique names, and you&#39;re ok with a few dropped transactions or occasional corruption, then 99.9% of the time yer gonna be fine. If there&#39;s a problem, reboot the computer, make sure there aren&#39;t any process collisions.  It&#39;s because of code like this that makes the tech support script: &quot;Have you tried restarting your computer&quot; a level 5 meme.  &quot;A Rogue Robot scraped  to find integers and sent those to , so reboot the computer to clear the problem.\nWhy not just use  which is easier?\nThe above gives me manual control because , , ,  and  are multi-platform standard.

            "body": "I know how terribly wrong it is to (attempt to) parse HTML with Regex, which is why I&#39;m trying really, really hard to avoid it.\n\nI have an app that generates HTML emails. We&#39;re using a big fancy WYSIWYG drop in email editor that takes care of generating responsive emails and also generates the abysmal markup for clients like MS Outlook. It does that last bit using conditional comments, which look something like the following. Note that the  has an  attribute, and wraps the  tag that non-mso clients will see.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one of dozens (possibly hundreds?) of possible formattings that we need to work with.\n\nPrior to the introduction of this editor, we asked our customers to generate their own HTML emails with a more rudimentary WYSIWYG HMTL editor; but it was incumbent on them to make responsive templates and test their content in various clients. From their perspective, this new editor is a huge win.\n\nAs we&#39;re sending emails, it&#39;s important to track the link clicks via a tracking link that redirects through to the originally-intended link.\n\nTo date, we&#39;ve used jSoup to parse the email content, looking for any anchor tags and replace their href attribute contents. Because regex html parsing is evil, right?\n\nConditional comments have thrown a wrench in those gears.\n\nBecause they are comments, jSoup ignores them, and clicks from MS Outlook and other clients that handle the  markup haven&#39;t been transformed to go through our link tracker, so the clicks don&#39;t get tracked. This is a problem for us.\n\n\n\nFirst idea: replace the conditional comments with a custom tag\n\nAt first I was hopeful to pre-process the message body before letting jSoup have it. I would replace  with  and  with . This was simple enough to do, even for complex forms of the conditions inside the comments. I used a regex to make some simple replacements:\n\n\n became \n became  \netc\n\n\nNotice that I url-encoded the original comment in its entirety. url-encoding it made sure that I could easily use regex to find my marker comments and transform them back (so that I didn&#39;t have to worry about  inside the &quot;orig&quot; attribute content...\n\nThis started to break down when I realized there were multiple possible ways the comments could be closed. I spent a little bit of time working on a similar approach for the closing tags.\n\n\n became \nsame approach for  and \n\n\nI don&#39;t know if you can have attributes on a closing tag. I never tested it because I had another realization before I got to that point. The realization was that using  wasn&#39;t going to produce desirable output from jSoup because the resulting INPUT would often look like:\n\n\n\nThis is not tidy HTML and jSoup will try to correct it, changing the order of tags to make something that it thinks is more correct. When I realized that, I stopped what I was doing and started thinking about the problem again.\n\n\n\nSecond idea: the same thing, but with comments\n\nIf the (new) problem was that jSoup didn&#39;t like my tag nesting, what if I could expose the HTML from inside the conditional comments as if it weren&#39;t commented out, but keep some markers in as comments that I can later transform back into comments? The goal was to aim at making this:\n\n\n\nThis should parse as fairly tidy HTML, right? So I made the code modifications and gave it a shot.\n\nSadly, the documents that we&#39;re working with are far more complex than the simple example I started from above. Here&#39;s the first few lines of an actual sample document:\n\n\n\nAfter the comment conversion, we&#39;ve effectively dropped an  block into the  block, of which jSoup is decidedly not a fan. This is what I get back for the above input, after converting the conditional comments into my plain marked comments, parsing with jSoup, and then converting my markers back to their conditional comments:\n\n\n\nThere are some big problems here. The  block gets basically immediately closed. The  tag moves up to before the  block, and everything that came after it moved down into the body. This isn&#39;t going to work.\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\nI feel like we&#39;re basically out of options. \n\n\nDo nothing and just don&#39;t count the clicks from MS Outlook/etc clients. In some cases we might be able to detect a click anyway via a downstream conversion on that email. (Even if we don&#39;t have record of you clicking the link, if you made a payment then we know you got there...)\nWe could let our mail provider do the link tracking for us (experimentation required; not positive they would track the  links either). Historically we started this system with a provider that didn&#39;t offer link tracking so we had to roll our own. Current provider offers it, but we&#39;ve got years of existing code and processes that would have to be updated to support this change. We&#39;re keeping it in our back pocket if we can&#39;t figure something else out, but the prospect of changing ships mid-stream is ... not appealing.\nOr lastly... maybe... regex? (/me ducks) We could let jSoup do its thing for the normal HTML, and then use regex to replace any links that remain. This becomes a game of whack-a-mole with current and future markup. What might we run into aside from a  in the future? &#175;\\_(ツ)_/&#175; And we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing without regular manual reviews.\n\n\nUnless there&#39;s another option that we haven&#39;t explored yet. So... are we stuck with nothing/regex?\n\nWe&#39;re on the JVM so anything Java is within reach, I guess.\n",

            "body": "The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Solution for Removing &quot;.html&quot; in NGINX:\nUPDATED ANSWER: This question piqued my curiosity, and I went on another, more in-depth search for a &quot;holy grail&quot; solution for  redirects in NGINX. Here is the link to the answer I found, since I didn&#39;t come up with it myself: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32966347/4175718\nHowever, I&#39;ll give an example and explain how it works. Here is the code:\n\nWhat&#39;s happening here is a pretty ingenious use of the  directive. NGINX runs a regex on the  portion of incoming requests. The regex checks if the URI has an .html extension and then stores the extension-less portion of the URI in the built-in variable .\nFrom the docs, since it took me a while to figure out where the  came from:\n\nRegular expressions can contain captures that are made available for later reuse in the $1..$9 variables.\n\nThe regex both checks for the existence of unwanted .html requests and effectively sanitizes the URI so that it does not include the extension. Then, using a simple  statement, the request is redirected to the sanitized URI that is now stored in .\nThe best part about this, as original author cnst explains, is that\n\nDue to the fact that $request_uri is always constant per request, and is not affected by other rewrites, it won&#39;t, in fact, form any infinite loops.\n\nUnlike the rewrites, which operate on any  request (including the invisible internal redirect to ), this solution only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.\nWhat does &quot;try_files&quot; do?\nYou will still need the  directive, as otherwise NGINX will have no idea what to do with the newly sanitized extension-less URIs. The  directive shown above will first try the new URL by itself, then try it with the &quot;.html&quot; extension, then try it as a directory name.\nThe NGINX docs also explain how the default  directive works. The default  directive is ordered differently than the example above so the explanation below does not perfectly line up:\n\nNGINX will first append  to the end of the URI and try to serve it. If it finds an appropriate  file, it will return that file and will maintain the extension-less URI. If it cannot find an appropriate  file, it will try the URI without any extension, then the URI as a directory, and then finally return a 404 error.\n\nUPDATE: What does the regex do?\nThe above answer touches on the use of regular expressions, but here is a more specific explanation for those who are still curious. The following regular expression (regex) is used:\n\nThis breaks down as:\n: indicates beginning of line.\n: match the character &quot;/&quot; literally. Forward slashes do NOT need to be escaped in NGINX.\n: capturing group: match any character an unlimited number of times\n: match the character &quot;.&quot; literally. This must be escaped with a backslash.\n: match the string &quot;html&quot; literally.\n: match a literal &quot;?&quot; or the end of the string. This is done to avoid mishandling file names with something after &quot;.html&quot;.\nThe capturing group  is what contains the non-&quot;.html&quot; portion of the URL. This can later be referenced with the variable . NGINX is then configured to re-try the request () and the  directive internally re-appends the &quot;.html&quot; extension so the file can be located.\nUPDATE: Retaining the query string\nTo retain query strings and arguments passed to a  page, the  statement can be changed to:\n\nThis should allow requests such as  to redirect to  instead of just .\n\nNote that this is considered safe usage of the `if` directive.\nFrom the NGINX page If Is Evil:\n\nThe only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:\nreturn ...;\nrewrite ... last;\n\n\nAlso, note that you may swap out the &#39;302&#39; redirect for a &#39;301&#39;.\nA  redirect is permanent, and is cached by web browsers and search engines. If your goal is to permanently remove the  extension from pages that are already indexed by a search engine, you will want to use a  redirect. However, if you are testing on a live site, it is best practice to start with a  and only move to a  when you are absolutely confident your configuration is working correctly.\n",

Fortunately, there is a way to avoid such a problems, and can be easily applied to an arbitrary number of sites as you ask for in your original question. You can check required conditions to make a decision for blocking the request or not using the (very powerful)  block feature. And since we want to match address against a list of subnets, we will use a chain of  and  blocks. To use regexes (PRCE/PCRE2 syntax) for a  block match use a  string prefix ( for case-insensitive match), strings containing some special characters (e.g. curly braces) should be single- or double-qouted. Here is a generic example (you&#39;ll need only the first line of the following  block to fulfill your question requirements):\n\nYou can swap the logic to check the URI first (it can be some performance impact since the regex matching will be performed for every request including requests from the non-restricted networks, however if the majority of requests come from public addresses, there will be no significant difference).

However, software engineers have added many extensions that take these implementations far beyond the formal definition. So, while most regular expression engines resemble one another, there is actually no standard. For this reason, a lot depends on what language, API, framework or library you are using.\n(Incidentally, to help reduce confusion, many have taken to using &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot; to describe these enhanced matching languages. See Is a Regex the Same as a Regular Expression? at RexEgg.com for more information.)\nThat said, most regex engines (actually, all of them, as far as I know) would accept . Most likely, there&#39;s an issue with escaping.\nThe Trouble with Escaping\nSome languages have built-in support for regexes, such as JavaScript. For those languages that don&#39;t, escaping can be a problem.\nThis is because you are basically coding in a language within a language. Java, for example, uses  as an escape character within it&#39;s strings, so if you want to place a literal backslash character within a string, you must escape it:\n\nHowever, regexes also use the  character for escaping, so if you want to match a literal  character, you must escape it for the regex engine, and then escape it again for Java:\n\nIn your case, you have probably not escaped the backslash character in the language you are programming in:\n\nAll this escaping can get very confusing. If the language you are working with supports raw strings, then you should use those to cut down on the number of backslashes, but not all languages do (most notably: Java). Fortunately, there&#39;s an alternative that will work some of the time:\n\nFor a regex engine,  and  mean exactly the same thing. Note that this doesn&#39;t work in every case, like newline (), open square bracket () and backslash ( or ).\nA Note about Matching Numbers\n(Hint: It&#39;s harder than you think)\nMatching a number is one of those things you&#39;d think is quite easy with regex, but it&#39;s actually pretty tricky. Let&#39;s take a look at your approach, piece by piece:\n\nMatch an optional  or \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\n\nMatch an optional \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\nFirst, we can clean up this expression a bit by using a character class shorthand for the digits (note that this is also susceptible to the escaping issue mentioned above):\n = \nI&#39;m going to use  below, but keep in mind that it means the same thing as . (Well, actually, in some engines  will match digits from all scripts, so it&#39;ll match more than  will, but that&#39;s probably not significant in your case.)\nNow, if you look at this carefully, you&#39;ll realize that every single part of your pattern is optional. This pattern can match a 0-length string; a string composed only of  or ; or, a string composed only of a . This is probably not what you&#39;ve intended.\nTo fix this, it&#39;s helpful to start by &quot;anchoring&quot; your regex with the bare-minimum required string, probably a single digit:\n\nNow we want to add the decimal part, but it doesn&#39;t go where you think it might:\n\nThis will still match values like . Worse, it&#39;s got a tinge of evil about it. The period is optional, meaning that you&#39;ve got two repeated classes side-by-side ( and ). This can actually be dangerous if used in just the wrong way, opening your system up to DoS attacks.\nTo fix this, rather than treating the period as optional, we need to treat it as required (to separate the repeated character classes) and instead make the entire decimal portion optional:\n\nThis is looking better now. We require a period between the first sequence of digits and the second, but there&#39;s a fatal flaw: we can&#39;t match  because a leading digit is now required.\nThis is actually pretty easy to fix. Instead of making the &quot;decimal&quot; portion of the number optional, we need to look at it as a sequence of characters: 1 or more numbers that may be prefixed by a  that may be prefixed by 0 or more numbers:\n\nNow we just add the sign:\n\nOf course, those slashes are pretty annoying in Java, so we can substitute in our long-form character classes:\n\nMatching versus Validating\nThis has come up in the comments a couple times, so I&#39;m adding an addendum on matching versus validating.\nThe goal of matching is to find some content within the input (the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;). The goal of validating is to ensure that the input is in an expected format.\nRegexes, by their nature, only match text. Given some input, they will either find some matching text or they will not. However, by &quot;snapping&quot; an expression to the beginning and ending of the input with anchor tags ( and ), we can ensure that no match is found unless the entire input matches the expression, effectively using regexes to validate.\nThe regex described above () will match one or more numbers within a target string. So given the input:\n\nThe regex will match , , ,  and .\nTo validate that a given input is a number and nothing but a number, &quot;snap&quot; the expression to the start and end of the input by wrapping it in anchor tags:\n\nThis will only find a match if the entire input is a floating point number, and will not find a match if the input contains additional characters. So, given the input , a match will be found, but given  no matches will be found.\nNote that some regex engines have a ,  or similar function, which essentially does what I&#39;ve described automatically, returning  if a match is found and  if no match is found. Also keep in mind that some engines allow you to set flags which change the definition of  and , matching the beginning/end of a line rather than the beginning/end of the entire input. This is typically not the default, but be on the lookout for these flags.\n",

            "body": "You can read this blog post that explains what most C# MIME parsers get wrong and why MimeKit can handle multiple charset encodings.\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/time-for-rant-on-mime-parsers.html\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-decoding-rfc2047-encoded-headers-is.html\nTime for a rant on mime parsers...\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\nWhere should I begin?\nI guess I should start by saying that I am obsessed with MIME and, in particular, MIME parsers. No, really. I am obsessed. Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ve written and/or worked on several MIME parsers at this point. It started off in my college days working on Spruce which had a horrendously bad MIME parser, and so as you read farther along in my rant about shitty MIME parsers, keep in mind: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve written a shitty MIME parser.\nAs a handful of people are aware, I&#39;ve recently started implementing a C# MIME parser called MimeKit. As I work on this, I&#39;ve been searching around on GitHub and Google to see what other MIME parsers exist out there to find out what sort of APIs they provide. I thought perhaps I&#39;ll find one that offers a well-designed API that will inspire me. Perhaps, by some miracle, I&#39;d find one that was actually pretty good that I could just contribute to instead of writing my own from scratch (yea, wishful thinking). Instead, all I have found are poorly designed and implemented MIME parsers, many probably belong on the front page of the Daily WTF.\nI guess I&#39;ll start with some softballs.\nFirst, there&#39;s the fact that every single one of them was written as  parsers. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ones claiming to be &quot;stream parsers&quot;, because all any of those did was to slap a  on top of the byte stream and start using . What&#39;s so bad about that, you ask? For those not familiar with MIME, I&#39;d like for you to take a look at the raw email sources in your inboxes particularly if you have correspondence with anyone outside of the US. Hopefully, most of your friends and colleagues are using more-or-less MIME compliant email clients, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find at least a few emails with raw 8bit text.\nNow, if the language they were using was C or C++, they might be able to get away with doing this because they&#39;d technically be operating on byte arrays, but with Java and C#, a &#39;string&#39; is a unicode string. Tell me: how does one get a unicode string from a raw byte array?\nBingo. You need to know the charset before you can convert those bytes into unicode characters.\nTo be fair, there&#39;s really no good way of handling raw 8bit text in message headers, but by using a  approach, you are really limiting the possibilities.\nNext up is the  approach. One of the 2 early parsers in GMime (pan-mime-parser.c back in the version 0.7 days) used a  approach, so I understand the thinking behind this. And really, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this approach as far as correctness goes, it&#39;s more of a &quot;this can never be fast&quot; complaint. Of the two early parsers in GMime, the pan-mime-parser.c backend was horribly slow compared to the in-memory parser. Of course, that&#39;s not very surprising. More surprising to me at the time was that when I wrote GMime&#39;s current generation of the parser (sometime between v0.7 and v1.0), it was just as fast as the in-memory parser ever was and only ever had up to 4k in a read buffer at any given time. My point is, there are far better approaches than  if you want your parser to be reasonably performant... and why wouldn&#39;t you want that? Your users definitely want that.\nOkay, now come the more serious problems that I encountered in nearly all of the mime parser libraries I found.\nI think that every single mime parser I&#39;ve found so far uses the &quot;String.Split()&quot; approach for parsing address headers and/or for parsing parameter lists on headers such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition.\nHere&#39;s an example from one C# MIME parser:\n\nHere&#39;s how this same parser decodes encoded-word tokens:\n\nWhat?! It completely throws away the charset in each of those encoded-word tokens. In the case of quoted-printable tokens, it assumes they are all ASCII (actually, latin1 may work as well?) and in the case of base64 encoded-word tokens, it assumes they are all in UTF-7!?!? Where in the world did he get that idea? I can&#39;t begin to imagine his code working on any base64 encoded-word tokens in the real world. &#129318;‍♂️\nI&#39;d just like to point out that this is what this project&#39;s description states:\nA small, efficient, and working mime parser library written in c#.\n...\nI&#39;ve used several open-source mime parsers before, but they all either\nfail on one kind of encoding or the other, or miss some crucial\ninformation. That&#39;s why I decided to finally have a go at the problem\nmyself.\nI&#39;ll grant you that his MIME parser is small, but I&#39;d have to take issue with the &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;working&quot; adjectives. With the heavy use of string allocations and regex matching, it could hardly be considered &quot;efficient&quot;. And as the code pointed out above illustrates, &quot;working&quot; is a bit of an overstatement.\nFolks... this is what you get when you opt for a &quot;lightweight&quot; MIME parser because you think that parsers like GMime are &quot;bloated&quot;.\nOn to parser #2... I like to call this the &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; approach:\n\nI&#39;ll give this guy some credit, at least he saw that his  approach was flawed and so tried to compensate by piecing Humpty Dumpty back together again. Of course, with his String.Trim()ing, he just won&#39;t be able to put him back together again with any level of certainty. The white space in those quoted tokens may have significant meaning.\nMany of the C# MIME parsers out there like to use Regex all over the place. Here&#39;s a snippet from one parser that is entirely written in Regex (yea, have fun maintaining that...):\n\nLet&#39;s pretend that the regex pattern strings are correct in their definitions (because they are god-awful to read and I can&#39;t be bothered to double-check them), the replacing of &#39;_&#39; with a space is wrong (it should only be done in the &quot;q&quot; case) and the  is just evil. Not to mention that there could be multiple encoded words per field.Body which this code utterly fails to handle.\nGuys. I know you love regular expressions and that they are very very useful, but they are no substitute for writing a real tokenizer. This is especially true if you want to be lenient in what you accept (and in the case of MIME, you really need to be).\n",

            "body": "Why Are Evil Regexes A Problem?\nBecause computers do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it&#39;s not what you meant or is totally unreasonable. If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

More on that later.\nIf you wanted to provide a generic means for calling functions, you could for example:\n\nI&#39;m using  here, since  is a language statement and not a function, and therefore wouldn&#39;t work like this. If you had to echo here, you&#39;d have to make your own echo wrapper function, like , and call that instead.\nOr, for more readable code, you could list the array as:\n\nIf you needed multiple arguments, you could use this structure:\n\nWhere the arguments listed in the arguments array, unpacked with the splat operator, are in the same order as the target function&#39;s arguments.\nThere are of course only a limited number of useful functions that will directly output anything. Therefore, in the above example we capture the result from  instead and then echo; this simply to illustrate the basic use of variable functions and arguments.\nThis approach will however provide unhinged access to any function in your system, and as such shouldn&#39;t be used on anything but data/calls from trusted sources (you). Allowing users to provide any commands will open up your system to a world of mischief and misery.\nTherefore, my initial recommendation of providing a map of functions. You could:\n\nHave an array with a list of allowed core functions,\nHave an array with a list of your custom wrapper functions, or\nCheck for valid wrapper functions named with a prefix\n\nYou could for example implement wrappers as follows:\n\nThis would give you control over what&#39;s executed, and also whether values are returned or output, etc. pre/post-process. And then iterate your variable commands as follows:\n\nFor an additional layer of insulation, create a class with your custom calls as its methods, instead of polluting the global space with more functions. Ciykd use a public router method that handles no-match cases; calling e.g. , where  returns the  methods.\nI often do something like this when I need to map user requests to class public methods that return output; named e.g. ,  etc. and  for a fallback for unmatched requests.

            "body": "PEP 585 -- Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections claims usability under both Python 3.7 and 3.8 with a standard  preamble. Notably:\n\nFor use cases restricted to type annotations, Python files with the  future-import (available since Python 3.7) can parameterize standard collections, including builtins.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, when  is used, function and variable annotations can parameterize standard collections directly. Example:\n\n\nWhile the above toy example does technically parse, that&#39;s about all it does. Attempting to actually use a parametrized builtin collection at runtime under either Python 3.7 or 3.8 invariably raises the dreaded  exception:\n\nNote the  statement is the standard idiom for resolving PEP 563-style postponed annotations at runtime. Don&#39;t even get me started on PEP 563.\nwho you gonna believe: me or your lying PEP?\nThis discourages the devout Pythonista in me. PEP 585 repeatedly claims that it preserves runtime usability:\n\nPreserving the generic type at runtime enables introspection of the type which can be used for API generation or runtime type checking. Such usage is already present in the wild.\n\n\nJust like with the  module today, the parameterized generic types listed in the previous section all preserve their type parameters at runtime:\n\n\nOf course, none of the above works under Python 3.7 or 3.8 – regardless of whether  is enabled or not:\n\nSo PEP 585 blatantly breaks the wild and all existing attempts to introspect generic types at runtime – especially from runtime type checkers. The entire &quot;Parameters to generics are available at runtime&quot; section is a charade.\nAm I missing something painfully obvious or are parametrized builtin collections the poison pill they superficially appear to be? Since evaluating these collections at runtime under Python 3.7 and 3.8 unconditionally raises exceptions, they&#39;re unusable at runtime – rendering them not simply useless but directly harmful for the widespread use case of type introspection and especially runtime type checking.\nbetween a rock and a hard PEP\nAny codebase type-hinting with parametrized builtin collections will be fundamentally incompatible with runtime type checkers under Python 3.7 and 3.8. Codebases preferring runtime to static type checking while preserving backward compatibility with Python &lt; 3.9 (which has yet to even be officially released as of this writing) thus have no choice but to avoid parametrized builtin collections entirely.\nExcept that too is infeasible. Why? Because PEP 585 deprecates the entire hierarchy of  pseudo-containers:\n\nImporting those [e.g., , , ] from  is deprecated. Due to PEP 563 and the intention to minimize the runtime impact of , this deprecation will not generate . Instead, type checkers may warn about such deprecated usage when the target version of the checked program is signalled to be Python 3.9 or newer. It&#39;s recommended to allow for those warnings to be silenced on a project-wide basis.\n\n\nThe deprecated functionality will be removed from the  module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0.\n\nConsider , for example. By 2025 (or shortly thereafter),  and thus  goes away. But  isn&#39;t safely parametrizable under Python 3.7 and 3.8, because doing so renders your project incompatible with anything that introspects types. So  isn&#39;t a viable option, either.\nSo there are no forward- and backward-compatible options. Instead, either:\n\nProhibit type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) entirely by just preferring builtin containers (e.g., ) to  pseudo-containers (e.g., ) or...\nSupport type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) by either:\n\nPreferring  pseudo-containers to builtin containers until 2025. At that time, both the project in question and all downstream projects of that project will need to be refactored as follows:\n\nDrop Python 3.7 and 3.8 support.\nReplace all  pseudo-containers with builtin containers.\n\n\nImmediately dropping Python 3.7 and 3.8 support by preferring builtin containers to  pseudo-containers. This has the distasteful disadvantage of requiring a currently unstable Python interpreter, but... that&#39;s technically an option. Somehow.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, there are no good options – only a spectrum of increasingly horrifying lessers of several malignant evils. One would hope that PEP authors would actually test their implementations at runtime. Yet, here we are, adrift without a paddle in a steaming cesspit of theorycrafted anti-APIs. Welcome to Python.\nbut that&#39;s not all\nThere is technically a third way. It&#39;s even more distasteful – but it should technically work. One awful theorycrafting deserves another, I always say!\nSince PEP 563-driven postponed annotations are merely strings, type introspection could cleverly run a regex-based replacement on each type being introspected. For each type that is a postponed annotation, globally replace each substring referencing a parametrized builtin container (e.g., ) in that annotation string with the corresponding substring referencing a parametrized  pseudo-container (e.g., ).\nThe result? A Python 3.7- and 3.8-compatible postponed annotation string safely evaluatable until 2025, at which point that internal replacement (and Python 3.7 and 3.8 support) could just be quietly dropped.\nThat&#39;s a totally cray-cray ludicrous speed kludge for the stars, but... that would probably work. The core issue, of course, is that one shouldn&#39;t need insane hackery just to comply with core official PEPs. But there&#39;s an even deeper underlying cultural issue underneath that technical issue. No one – neither the author of PEP 585 nor any of the commentators reviewing PEP 585 – actually tested their new hypothetical proposed functionality before deprecating the existing well-tested functionality that actually worked.\nCore official PEPs should just work out of the box. Increasingly, they don&#39;t. And that should concern everyone.\n",

            "body": "Oh Yes You Can Use Regexes to Parse HTML!\nFor the task you are attempting, regexes are perfectly fine!\nIt is true that most people underestimate the difficulty of parsing HTML with regular expressions and therefore do so poorly.\nBut this is not some fundamental flaw related to computational theory. That silliness is parroted a lot around here, but don’t you believe them.\nSo while it certainly can be done (this posting serves as an existence proof of this incontrovertible fact), that doesn’t mean it&#160;should&#160;be.\nYou must decide for yourself whether you’re up to the task of writing what amounts to a dedicated, special-purpose HTML parser out of regexes. Most people are not.\nBut I am. ☻\n\nGeneral Regex-Based HTML Parsing Solutions\nFirst I’ll show how easy it is to parse arbitrary HTML with regexes. The full program’s at the end of this posting, but the heart of the parser is:\n\nSee how easy that is to read?\nAs written, it identifies each piece of HTML and tells  where it found that piece. You could easily modify it to do whatever else you want with any given type of piece, or for more particular types than these.\nI have no failing test cases (left :): I’ve successfully run this code on more than 100,000 HTML files — every single one I could quickly and easily get my hands on. Beyond those, I’ve also run it on files specifically constructed to break na&#239;ve parsers.\nThis is not a na&#239;ve parser.\nOh, I’m sure it isn’t perfect, but I haven’t managed to break it yet.  I figure that even if something did, the fix would be easy to fit in because of the program’s clear structure. Even regex-heavy programs should have stucture.\nNow that that’s out of the way, let me address the OP’s question.\nDemo of Solving the OP’s Task Using Regexes\nThe little  program I include below produces the following output, so that you can see that parsing HTML with regexes works just fine for what you wish to do:\n\nParse Input Tags, See No Evil Input\nHere’s the source for the program that produced the output above.\n\nThere you go! Nothing to it! :)\nOnly  you can judge whether your skill with regexes is up to any particular parsing task. Everyone’s level of skill is different, and every new task is different. For jobs where you have a well-defined input set, regexes are obviously the right choice, because it is trivial to put some together when you have a restricted subset of HTML to deal with. Even regex beginners should be handle those jobs with regexes.  Anything else is overkill.\nHowever, once the HTML starts becoming less nailed down, once it starts to ramify in ways you cannot predict but which are perfectly legal, once you have to match more different sorts of things or with more complex dependencies, you will eventually reach a point where you have to work harder to effect a solution that uses regexes than you would have to using a parsing class. Where that break-even point falls  depends again on your own comfort level with regexes.\nSo What Should I Do?\nI’m not going to tell you what you must do or what you cannot do.  I think that’s Wrong. I just want to present you with possibilties, open your eyes a bit. You get to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. There are no absolutes — and nobody else knows your own situation as well as you yourself do. If something seems like it’s too much work, well, maybe it is.  Programming should be fun, you know. If it isn’t, you may be doing it wrong.\nOne can look at my  program in any number of valid ways.  One such is that you indeed can parse HTML with regular expressions. But another is that it is much, much, much harder than almost anyone ever thinks it is. This can easily lead to the conclusion that my program is a testament to what you should not do, because it really is too hard.\nI won’t disagree with that.  Certainly if everything I do in my program doesn’t make sense to you after some study, then you should not be attempting to use regexes for this kind of task. For specific HTML, regexes are great, but for generic HTML, they’re tantamount to madness. I use parsing classes all the time, especially if it’s HTML I haven’t generated myself.\nRegexes  optimal for small HTML parsing problems,  pessimal for large ones\nEven if my program is taken as  illustrative of why you should not use regexes for parsing general HTML — which is OK, because I kinda meant for it to be that ☺  — it still should be an eye-opener so more people break the terribly common and nasty, nasty habit of writing unreadable, unstructured, and unmaintainable patterns.\nPatterns do not have to be ugly, and they do not have to be hard. If you create ugly patterns, it is a reflection on you, not them.\nPhenomenally Exquisite Regex Language\nI’ve been asked to point out that my proferred solution to your problem has been written in Perl. Are you surprised? Did you not notice? Is this revelation a bombshell?\nIt is true that not all other tools and programming languages are quite as convenient, expressive, and powerful when it comes to regexes as Perl is. There’s a big spectrum out there, with some being more suitable than others.  In general, the languages that have expressed regexes as part of the core language instead of as a library are easier to work with. I’ve done nothing with regexes that you couldn’t do in, say, PCRE, although you would structure the program differently if you were using C.\nEventually other languages will be catch up with where Perl is now in terms of regexes.  I say this because back when Perl started, nobody else had anything like Perl’s regexes. Say anything you like, but this is where Perl clearly won: everybody copied Perl’s regexes albeit at varying stages of their development.  Perl pioneered almost (not quite all, but almost) everything that you have come to rely on in modern patterns today, no matter what tool or language you use.  So eventually the others will catch up.\nBut they’ll only catch up to where Perl was sometime in the past, just as it is now.  Everything advances.  In regexes if nothing else, where Perl leads, others follow. Where will Perl be once everybody else finally catches up to where Perl is now?  I have no idea, but I know we too will have moved. Probably we’ll be closer to Perl₆’s style of crafting patterns.\nIf you like that kind  of thing but would like to use it in Perl₅,  you might be interested in Damian Conway’s wonderful Regexp::Grammars module. It’s completely awesome, and makes what I’ve done here in my program seem just as primitive as mine makes the patterns that people cram together without whitespace or alphabetic identifiers.  Check it out!\n\nSimple HTML Chunker\nHere is the complete source to the parser I showed the centerpiece from at the beginning of this posting.\nI am not suggesting that you should use this over a rigorously tested parsing class. But I am tired of people pretending that nobody can parse HTML with regexes just because they can’t. You clearly can, and this program is proof of that assertion.\nSure,  it isn’t easy, but it is possible!\nAnd trying to do so is a terrible waste of time, because good parsing classes exist which you should use for this task.  The right answer to people trying to parse arbitrary HTML is not that it is impossible.  That is a facile and disingenuous answer.  The correct and honest answer is that they shouldn’t attempt it because it is too much of a bother to figure out from scratch; they should not  break their back striving to re&#239;nvent a wheel that works perfectly well.\nOn the other hand, HTML that falls within a predicable subset is ultra-easy to parse with regexes. It’s no wonder people try to use them, because for small problems, toy problems perhaps, nothing could be easier. That’s why it’s so important to distinguish the two tasks — specific vs generic — as these do not necessarily demand the same approach.\nI hope in the future here to see a more fair and honest treatment of questions about HTML and regexes.\nHere’s my HTML lexer.  It doesn’t try to do a validating parse; it just identifies the lexical elements. You might think of it more as an HTML chunker than an HTML parser. It isn’t very forgiving of broken HTML, although it makes some very small allowances in that direction.\nEven if you never parse full HTML yourself (and why should you? it’s a solved problem!), this program has lots of cool regex bits that I believe a lot of people can learn a lot from.

            "body": "Sending headers earlier than the normal course may have far reaching consequences. Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nYou may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\nFinally, many PHP frameworks including Symfony, Zend and Laravel (there is no mention of this in the coding guidelines but it follows the suit) and the PSR-2 standard (item 2.2) require omission of the closing tag. PHP manual itself (1,2), Wordpress, Drupal and many other PHP software I guess, advise to do so. If you simply make a habit of following the standard (and setup PHP-CS-Fixer for your code) you can forget the issue. Otherwise you will always need to keep the issue in your mind.\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after . An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code. Bonus in bonus: A regex for deleting needless PHP endings: replace  with empty text in all files that contain PHP code.\n\n",

            "body": "There doesn&#39;t seem to be a great answer for this, after trying many things.\nIf there is an answer to the question it might be that there&#39;s no good way to do it. I think it doesn&#39;t hurt to look at potential solutions though and the drawbacks of each one.\n\nSolution 1\n\nUse componentWillUpdate. This is deprecated.\n\nSolution 2\n\nValidate state on render - but in your case and in most others, validation may lead to setState, which react tells you never to do in render(), but doesn&#39;t go into any detail about what will actually happen. Of course, you would have to be careful to prevent infinite loops, but if you call setState in render() upon some condition which cannot logically result in an infinite loop, then what unintended side effects could occur? \n\nSolution 3\n\nAs above, make a wrapper function to both validate and set state. But this is no good in my opinion because any state changes done with set state directly cannot be validated. Not only does setState directly not call your validation, but your validation also does not run on the items in the initial state. You might say, why would you give your component an initial state that&#39;s invalid, but I don&#39;t care, if I want to validate state I want it to validate 50000% of the time and no less.\n\nIn a complex form example, there are other issues with this. What if the validity of one field depends on the state of another field? Surely then, a function to re-validate a field when it changes is not enough. Some people will say to test the field being passed in and dispatch multiple events for re-validation, but again, this just isn&#39;t acceptable to me. Its not fullproof, it can lead to bugs, and make things hard to test. \n\nSolution 4\n\nUse componentWillReceiveProps. Not only is this deprecated, but its also static, meaning that you don&#39;t have access to the component instance. For some components this is fine because you can still modify the state that is returned, but if your component has data outside of state and props then you cannot access it, in addition to not being able to use non-static methods, which in my opinion makes this method pretty useless in many situations.\n\nSolution 5\n\nHaven&#39;t tested this one (bear with me, its fairly nuts), but you can override setState function in your component. Insert a callback into every setState instance. Track how many times setState is called and how many times the setState callback is called. Inside the callback, you can check the two counters stored in the object to see if the last callback is currently running, then, if it is, run one function which validates all state. On render, set both of the counters back down to zero. I don&#39;t recommend this by any means. It may work but its a pretty major hack.\n\nSolution 6\n\nYou can use componentDidUpdate, but this is inefficient. You will be blindly setting state with a value that was not validated then letting your component render only to validate it after and possibly call render again. Once again you have to be careful to avoid infinite loop while calling setState in componentDidUpdate. I read elsewhere that at least if you set the state here, the DOM will only re-draw once. In other words, it doesn&#39;t draw immediately after render() but waits until componentDidUpdate is triggered and re-calls render if state changes in there. This seems like maybe its the only solution I know about that react only warns about without telling you explicitely not to do this. In your case, the efficiency does not matter, but what if the state you were trying to validate was a 100 field form with a very expensive render method. Now, on every key down you&#39;ve essentially doubled the amount of work that react has to do to render your components, causing them to first render without being validated, and then filtering and/or validating them for a very likely second render.\n\nAdditional Issues\n\nIn my case, i&#39;m working on a form and not a simple component like you described above. I may go with a mix of solution 3 and 5. Its more complicated then I want though. It involves using one function to filter, generate errors, and set the state for each field (ie. solution 3). And then on componenetDidUpdate I may look for state keys whose values are different from the last value that the field was validated with. The second step here has many ways of doing so, all of which are messy and inefficient. To make it worse, they practically never run under normal circumstances because I always use the first function to update and validate their state, so this makes testing it harder. It&#39;s like leaving some fallback in my app that seems to work but during the entire development process it never triggers except for like the one time that I decided to test it. Seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nThere are additional efficiency concerns I also won&#39;t get into which relates to trying not to re-validate a field if it has the same value it was validated with last time. This is a whole other can of worms, but basically what it boils down to is that you should be able to not only validate a state before render, but you should have access to the previous state as well, so you can save some cpu time and only validate the fields that changed. For example, if you have a very long textarea with some complex regex, it would be nice to not validate that on every component render even if its a separate field that is changing.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nI&#39;m very thoroughly disappointed that react seems to provide no legitimate option for this. Seeing as you can call setState many times in one operation, and each one will be queued, how is it that they don&#39;t provide us with one callback after all state changes are resolved and we&#39;re about to render? Well if you think about it, the render function itself is this callback, because I think its only ever called after setStates are resolved, but again, its evil to call setState on render, and it would be a million times cleaner to have render() simply receive the correct state, so I don&#39;t see how this is very useful.\n\nDoes anyone know why they decided to get rid of componentWillUpdate?\n",

            "body": "Short answer: Don&#39;t (re)build a parser in Node.js, use the browser instead\n\nI strongly advise against evaluating or parsing crawled data in Node.js if you are anyway using puppeteer for crawling. When you are using puppeteer you already have a browser with a great sandbox for JavaScript code running in another process. Why risk that kind of isolation and &quot;rebuild&quot; a parser in your Node.js script? If your Node.js script breaks, your whole script will fail. In the worst case, you might even expose your machine to serious risks when you try to run untrusted code inside your main thread.\n\nInstead, try to do as much parsing as possible inside the context of the page. You can even do an evil  call there. There worst that could happen? Your browser hangs or crashes.\n\nExample\n\nImagine the following HTML page (very much simplified). You are trying to read the text which is pushed into an array. The only information you have is that there is an additional attribute  which is set to .\n\n\n\nBad code\n\nHere is a simple example what your code might look like right now:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the script extracts the JavaScript code from the page. Now we have the JavaScript code from the page and we &quot;only&quot; need to parse it, right? Well, this is the wrong approach. Don&#39;t try to rebuild a parser inside Node.js. Just use the browser. There are basically two approaches you can take to do that in your case.\n\n\nInject proxy functions into the page and fake some built-in functions (recommended)\nParse the data on the client-side (!) by using , a regex or  (eval only if really necessary)\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Inject proxy functions into the page\n\nIn this approach you are replacing native browser functions with your own &quot;fake functions&quot;. Example:\n\n\n\nThis code replaces the original  function with our own function. Everything works as normal, but when an item with our target id is pushed into an array, a special condition is triggered. To inject this function into the page, you could use . To receive the data from Node.js you would have to expose a function to the browser via :\n\n\n\nNow it doesn&#39;t really matter how complex the code of the page is, whether it happens inside some asynchronous handler or whether the page changes the surrounding code. As long as the target data is pushing the data into an array, we will get it.\n\nYou can use this approach for a lot of crawling. Check how the data is processed and replace the low level functions processing the data with your own proxy version of it.\n\nOption 2: Parse the data\n\nLet&#39;s assume the first approach does not work for some reason. The data is in some script tag, but you are not able to get it by using fake functions.\n\nThen you should parse the data, but not inside your Node.js environment. Do it inside the page context. You could run a regular expression or use . But do it before returning the data back to Node.js. This approach has the benefit that if your code will crash your environment for some reason, it will not be your main script, but just your browser that crashes.\n\nTo give some example code. Instead of running the code from the original &quot;bad code&quot; sample, we change it to this:\n\n\n\nThis will only return the parts of the code we need, which can then be fruther processed from within Node.js.\n\n\n\nIndependent of which approach you choose, both ways are much better and more secure than running unknown code inside your main thread. If you absolutely have to process the data in your Node.js environment, use a regular expression for it like shown in the answer from trincot. You should never use eval to run untrusted code.\n",

The official &quot;If is Evil&quot; page shows essentially the following as a good way to do things:\n\n\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to these various approaches.  One big advantage to a regex is that you can capture parts of the match and use them to modify the response.  Of course, you can usually achieve similar results with the other approaches by either setting a variable in the original block or using .  The downside of the regex approach is that it can get unwieldy if you want to match a variety of locations, plus the low precedence of a regex might just not fit with how you want to match locations —&#160;not to mention that  there are apparently performance impacts from regexes in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of including files (as far as I can tell) is that it is a little more flexible about exactly what you can include —&#160;it doesn&#39;t have to be a full location block, for example.  But it&#39;s also just subjectively a bit clunkier than named locations.\n\nAlso note that there is a related solution that you may be able to use in similar situations: nested locations.  The idea is that you would start with a very general location, apply some configuration common to several of the possible matches, and then have separate nested locations for the different types of paths that you want to match.

Basically, catastrophic backtracking happens when a regex fails to match and different permutations of the same regex can find a partial match.  The regex engine then tries all those permutations.  If you want to go over your code and inspect your regexes these are the 3 key issues to look at:\n\n\nAlternatives must be mutually exclusive.  If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails.  If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.  A classic example is  to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a &quot;dot matches line breaks&quot; mode.  If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces (matched by both  and ) will break the regex.  The fix is to use  to make the alternatives mutually exclusive or even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as  for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.\nQuantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive what comes between them.  Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match.  A classic example is  to match 3 things with &quot;anything&quot; between them. When  can&#39;t be matched the first  will expand character by character until the end of the line or file.  For each expansion the second  will expand character by character to match the remainder of the line or file.  The fix is to realize that you can&#39;t have &quot;anything&quot; between them.  The first run needs to stop at  and the second run needs to stop at .  With single characters  is an easy solution.  Since we now stop at the delimiter, we can use possessive quantifiers to further increase performance.\nA group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it.  That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.  This is the problem illustrated in JDB&#39;s answer.\n\n\nWhile I was writing my answer I decided that this merited a full article on my website.  This is now online too.\n",

They have a sweet point (mainly simple assignment or builtin operations). But if the actor is any kind of non-trivial you&#39;ll see the complexity ramp up quickly, not just for the human but also for the compiler. This leads to\n\n\nslow compilation\nsub-optimal emitted code\nharder to maintain source\nnew classes of error (e.g. when the expression templates hold references to locals/temporaries, something that Boost Proto (and hence Phoenix) does not prevent or signal. In fact, it encourages it by assuming all template expressions are ephemeral, but I digress).\n\n\n\n  Interestingly: Spirit X3 dropped Phoenix altogether, even though Phoenix was once the brain child of Spirit&#179;.\n  \n  The new style uses c++14 polymorphic lambdas, that look 90% like the helper function object in the original code, but inline as a lambda.\n\n\nThis specific case\n\nCan&#39;t work. At all.\n\nThe problem is that you&#39;re mixing lazy/deferred actors with direct invocations. That can never work. The type of  isn&#39;t supposed to be . Of course. It is supposed to be a lazy actor&#185; that can be used at some later time to create a . \n\nNow that we know that (and why)  is an actor type, it should become clear why it is completely bogus to call  on it. You might as well say\n\n\n\nAnd wonder why it would not compile.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should probably just have the dedicated functor. You can of course Phoenix-adapt the regex functions you require, but all it does is shift the complexity tax for some syntactic sugar.\n\nI&#39;d always opt for the more naive approach that is going to be more understandable to a seasoned c++ programmer, and avoids pitfalls that come with high-wire acts&#178;.\n\nNevertheless, here&#39;s a pointer should you be curious:\n\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/phoenix/modules/function.html\n\nLive On Coliru\n\n\n\n\n\n&#185; think composed function object that can be invoked at a later time\n\n&#178; the balance might tip if you were designing this as an EDSL for further configuration by non-experts, but then you will have the added responsibility of documenting your EDSL and the constraints in which it can be used\n\n&#179; should we say, spirit-child of a brain?\n",

            "body": "The worst input for a regular expression will vary from engine to engine. The same regex and string may take no time at all on one engine, but never finish on another.\n\nDifferences between engines\n\nEngine Type\n\nFor certain engines, the &quot;evilest&quot; regex is still benign, running in linear time (or  time when both the length of the regex and the length of the string may vary.) Of course, the reason for this is the implementation. These engines don&#39;t backtrack; instead they use a finite state machine (FSM).\n\nNote that some backtracking implementations use FSM, but only as an intermediate step. Don&#39;t let this confuse you; they&#39;re not FSM.\n\nMost of the old regex engines (like sed) use FSM matching. There are a few new engines that use this implementation, such as Go. PCRE even has DFA functions (search for &quot;DFA&quot; here) that use this type of matching.\n\nAnother answer of mine also addresses the potential speed difference between the two implementations.\n\nIt would be wise to consider using a FSM implementation if you are really worried about malicious input affecting the speed of your regex. Unfortunately, FSM is not as powerful as the other implementation; it lacks support for some features, such as back references.\n\nOptimizations\n\nEvil is actually a bit subjective. Something evil to one regex engine may not be evil to a different engine. An evil plot can be thwarted if the engine is optimized. Optimizations are particularly important to backtracking engines, given their potential exponential run time.\n\nShort-circuiting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the engine may be able to quickly determine a match is impossible. While running the regex  against the string , Regex101 says:\n\n\n  Your match failed outright. What this means is the engine, due to its internal optimizations, understood that your pattern would never match at any position, and thus did not even attempt to.\n\n\nKeep in mind that Wikipedia says the regex is evil, especially when paired with that string.\n\nOf course, the engine is smart to not need to backtrack to determine the match wouldn&#39;t work. It saw something pretty obvious: the regex needs an  in order to match, but no  was present in the string.\n\nModifiers\n\nI mention this because you might not expect modifiers to be a factor in regex performance. But they are.\n\nEven PCRE, one of the more optimized implementations, may take considerably more steps with both the  and  modifiers enabled. See my question here for more information about this. In the end, I figured out that only certain characters trigger this behavior.\n\nAnalyzing Strings\n\nString length\n\nIn general, a long string will be slower than a short string. In fact, if you find a string of length x that causes catastrophic backtracking, you can make it backtrack a bit more by increasing the length of the string.\n\nGreedy vs. Lazy\n\nCompare the speeds of these regexes:\n\n\n  on \n on \n  on \n on \n\n\nEssentially, greedy matching is best when you think you will need to match a lot. Lazy matching is best when you need to match only a little.\n\nNote that if you change the regex to  or , then the engine may optimize things considerably.\n\nBrute force testing\n\nThere are several frameworks that are specifically designed to try to find vulnerabilities in your regexes. It may be worthwhile to try one out.\n\nThere&#39;s really one thing that I will suggest if you wanted to try making your own algorithm. It&#39;s not practical to try all characters in the dictionary, especially if you want to test long strings.\n\nInstead, look at your regex to determine what characters you should test. If you have  as your regex, there are really only two things that go into the match:  and not . You could really just imagine that there are only two characters:  and  (aka not ) when you generate your strings to brute force with.\n\nSetting timeouts\n\nIt would be fantastic to be able to ensure your regex finishes before the heat death of the universe, right? Some regex engines do have a way to set a time out.\n\n.NET:\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\n\n  \n  \n  Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it exists, the  value defined in the .\n  \n  When called,  restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script execution a call such as  is made, the script will run for a total of 45 seconds before timing out.\n\n\nPerl\n\nYou might as well visit the link, since it&#39;s right on Stack Overflow.\n",

            "body": "TL;DR\n\nIn short, &quot;backtracking&quot; is when a regex engine returns to a &quot;flexible&quot; match, attempting a different path to get a successful match.\n\nBacktracking with Alternation\n\nFor example, in the following pattern and input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regex engine will match &quot;foo&quot;, then attempt the first of the two options, matching &quot;b&quot; and then &quot;a&quot;, but fails at &quot;r&quot;. Rather than failing the whole match, though, it will &quot;rewind the tape&quot; and start with the second alternative, matching &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; and then &quot;z&quot;... success!\n\nBacktracking with Quantifiers\n\nThis also works with quantifiers. A quantifier is anything that encourages the engine to match a repeating pattern, including , ,  and  (depending on the engine).\n\nA greedy quantifier (the default) will match as many repetitions as possible before moving on to the rest of the pattern. For example, given the pattern and input below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern  will begin by matching the entire string: &quot;foobar&quot;. However, when it moves on to the , the regex engine has reach the end of the input and the match fails. Rather than simply giving up, the engine will ask the last greedy quantifier to give up one of its repetitions, now matching &quot;fooba&quot;. The match still fails, so the engine asks  to give up the &quot;a&quot; (failure), and then the &quot;b&quot;. After giving up the &quot;b&quot;, the engine can now match , and the match succeeds.\n\nTrees and Backtracking\n\nAnother way of thinking of a regex is as a &quot;tree&quot;, and backtracking is going back up a node and trying another path. Given the pattern  and the input &quot;foobaz&quot;, the engine will attempt something like the following:\n\n\n\nCounting the &quot;Backtracks&quot;\n\nAs to why you see differences in the &quot;number&quot; of backtracks... this probably has a lot to do with internal optimizations and logging level. For example, RegexBuddy does not appear to be logging the match to the empty string before , while regex101 does. In the end, though, it doesn&#39;t really matter what exact order you backtrack in (what order you climb back up the tree) so long as you end up with the same result.\n\nEvil Regexes\n\nYou already know this, but for the benefit of anyone else who happens by, your regex was written to demonstrate &quot;catastrophic backtracking&quot; (aka &quot;evil regex&quot;), where the number of backtrack attempts grows exponentially as the length of the input increases. These regexes can be exploited to perform DoS attacks, so you must use caution not to introduce these into your patterns (as I found out).\n",

Regexes can however &quot;extract&quot; data. Extracting is what they&#39;re made for. The major drawback of regex HTML extraction over proper SGML toolkits or baseline XML parsers are their syntactic effort and varying reliability.\n\nConsider that making a somewhat dependable HTML extraction regex:\n\n\n\nis way less readable than a simple phpQuery or QueryPath equivalent:\n\n\n\nThere are however specific use cases where they can help.\n\n\nMany DOM traversal frontends don&#39;t reveal HTML comments , which however are sometimes the more useful anchors for extraction. In particular pseudo-HTML variations  or SGML residues are easy to tame with regexps.\nOftentimes regular expressions can save post-processing. However HTML entities often require manual caretaking.\nAnd lastly, for extremely simple tasks like extracting &lt;img src= urls, they are in fact a probable tool. The speed advantage over SGML/XML parsers mostly just comes to play for these very basic extraction procedures.\n\n\nIt&#39;s sometimes even advisable to pre-extract a snippet of HTML using regular expressions  and process the remainder using the simpler HTML parser frontends.\n\nNote: I actually have this app, where I employ XML parsing and regular expressions alternatively. Just last week the PyQuery parsing broke, and the regex still worked. Yes weird, and I can&#39;t explain it myself.

To match  or  , we form the regex  .\n  As before, Perl will try to match the regex at the earliest possible\n  point in the string. At each character position, Perl will first try\n  to match the first alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match, Perl will\n  then try the next alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match either, then\n  the match fails and Perl moves to the next position in the string.\n  Some examples:\n\n\n  \n  Even though  is the first alternative in the second regex,  is able to match\n  earlier in the string.\n\n\n  \n  Here, all the alternatives match at the first string position, so the\n  first alternative is the one that matches. If some of the alternatives\n  are truncations of the others, put the longest ones first to give them\n  a chance to match.\n\n\n  \n  The last example points out \n  that character classes are like alternations of characters. At a given\n  character position, the first alternative that allows the regexp match\n  to succeed will be the one that matches.\n\n\nSo this should explain the price you pay when using alternations in regex.\n\nWhen putting simple regex together, you don&#39;t pay such a price. It&#39;s well explained in another related question in SO. When directly searching for a constant string, or a set of characters as in the question, optimizations can be done and no backtracking is needed which means potentially faster code.\n\nWhen defining the regex alternations, just choosing a good order (putting the most common findings first) can influence the performance. It is not the same either to choose between two options, or twenty. As always, premature optimization is the root of all evil and you should instrumentiate you code (Devel::NYTProf) if there are problems or you want improvements. But as a general rule alternations should be kept to a minimum and avoided if possible since:\n\n\nThey easily make the regex too big an complex.

Then again, although this works well if you want the user to choose the files they&#39;re uploading, it might not be the best solution if you want to implement some kind of HTML5 drag&#39;n&#39;drop solution, etc. \n\nCoincidentally, I spent pretty much all of last week studying how to upload files via javascript to ASP.NET web forms. I developed a drag and drop interface that uses HTML5, and also developed a fail-over method with which the user could choose and upload their files via the  control.\n\nDue to the feature being low-priority, we only fully developed the  control, but I&#39;m happy to share that feature with you here:\n\nHTML\n\nWe&#39;re going to create an ASP file upload control, and hide certain parts of it.

            "body": "I have the following HTML and I need to remove the script tags and any script related attributes in the HTML. By script related attributes I mean any attribute that starts with on. \n\n\n\nMy first thought was to use BeautifulSoup to remove the tags and attributes. Unfortunately, I am unable to use BeautifulSoup. Seeing that BeautifulSoup is off the table I can see two options for doing this. The first option I see is splitting the strings and parsing based on index. This seems like a bad solution to me.\n\nThe other option is to use Regular Expressions. However, we know that isn&#39;t a good solution either (Cthulhu Parsing).\n\nNow with that in mind, I personally feel it is alright to use regular expressions to strip the attributes. After all, with those it is still simple string manipulation. \n\nSo for removing the attributes I have:\n\n\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I personally think the above perfectly acceptable use of Regular Expression with HTML. But still I would like to get some opinions on the above usage. \n\nThen there is the question of the script tags. I&#39;m very tempted to go with Regular Expressions for this because I know them and I know what I need is pretty simple. Something like:\n\n\n\nThe above would start to get me close to what I need. And yes I realize the above RegEx will grab everything starting at the first opening script tag until the last closing script tag, but it&#39;s a starting example. \n\nI&#39;m very tempted to use Regular Expressions as I&#39;m familiar with them (more so than Python) and I know that is the quickest way to achieve the results I want, at least for me it is. \n\nSo I need help to go against my nature and not be evil. I want to be evil and use RegEx so somebody please show me the light and guide me to the promised land on non-Regular Expressions.\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt looks like I wasn&#39;t very clear about what my question actually is, I apologize for that. My question is how can I parse the HTML using pure Python without Regular Expressions? \n\n\n\nAs for the above code example, it&#39;s wrong. I know it is wrong, I was using it as an example of a starting point. \n\nI hope this clears up my question some\n\nUpdate 2\n\nI just wanted to add a few more notes about what I am  doing. \n\nI am crawling a web site to get the data I need.\n\nOnce we have the page that contains the data we need it is saved to the database.\n\nThen the saved web page is displayed to the user.\n\nThe issue I am trying to solve happens here. The application throws a script error when you attempt to interact with the page that forces the user to click on a confirmation box. The application is not a web browser but uses the web browser DLL in Windows (I cannot remember the name at the moment).\n\nThe error in question only happens in this one page for this one web site.\n\nUpdate 3\n\nAfter adding the update I realized I was over thinking the problem, I was looking for a more generic solution. However, in this case that isn&#39;t what is needed. \n\nThe page is dynamically generated, however the script tags will stay static. With that in mind the solution becomes much simpler. With that I no longer need to treat it like HTML but as static strings.\n\nSo the solution I&#39;m looking at is\n\n\n\nI would like to avoid Regular Expression however, since I&#39;m limited to only using the standard library regular expressions seems like the best solution in this case.

And there is never a good reason.\nin the worst case  makes your application vulnerable to injection attacks and also it&#39;s very slow. A bit of research reveals plenty of reasons why eval is a big no-no.\nDon&#39;t save your calculation code into the database\nIf you do so and you would like to switch from PHP to another language you would still have PHP code in your database. It makes it really hard to migrate languages. You should always strive to make as many parts of your application as independent as possible.\nIn this case you would tight-couple the language you use, to the database. That&#39;s a bad practice.\nAlso the only possibilities to run your calculations from the database would be to eval them (which is bad, see above) or to disassemble the string with string operations or regex which causes unnecessary effort.\nIt&#39;s all about Strategy\nIn order to solve your problem you must execute code dependent of which calculation you need. That could be either done with switch-case-statements or if-statements. But that&#39;s also not a very elegant solution. Imagine you would need to execute other operations before calculating in the future, or extend functionality. You would need to update all your cases or if-statements.\nThere is a nice design-pattern which is called Strategy Pattern. The strategy pattern solves problems when one use-case can be handled differently which is probably what you want.\nYou want to calculate something (use-case) and there are different calculation types for it (different strategies)\nHow it works\nTo implement the Strategy pattern you basically need three things.\n\nA class where you inject your strategies. It&#39;s basically a wrapper for your strategy tasks.\nAn interface which will be implemented by your strategies\nYour strategies\n\nYour interface could look like this:\n\nThe interface will make sure that all your strategies provide a method to actually run the calculation. Nothing special.\nNext you may want to have a base class that takes your calculation operators as constructor arguments and stores them into properties.\n\nNow it&#39;s getting serious. We are implementing our strategies.\n\nOf course you could clean this one up a bit, but what I want to point out here is the class declaration.\nWe are extending our  class so that we can pass the arithmetic operations via constructor and we are implementing the  which tells our class: &quot;Hey! You must provide a calculate method, I don&#39;t care whether you want or not.\nWe&#39;ll see later why this is an integral part of the pattern.\nSo we have two concrete classes that contain the actual code for the actual arithmetic operation. If you would ever need to, you could change it easily as you see.\nTo add more operations just add another class.\nNow we will create a class where our strategies can be injected. Later you will instantiate an object of this class and work with it.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\nThe most important part here is the constructor. See how we type-hint our interface here. By doing that we make sure that only an object can be injected (Dependency Injection) whose class implements the interface. We do not need to demand a concrete class here. That&#39;s the crucial point here.\nAlso there&#39;s a calculate method in there. It&#39;s just a wrapper for our strategy to execute it&#39;s calculate method.\nWrapping it up\nSo now we just need to create an object of our  class and pass an object of one of our strategy classes (that contain the code for the arithmetic operations).\n\nTry replacing the string stored in  to  and you see that the operation for calculating the percentage will be executed.\nConclusion\nThe strategy pattern allowed you to create a clean interface for working with dynamic tasks that are only made concrete during runtime. Neither your database needs to know how we calculate things, nor your actual calculator does. The only thing we need to make sure is to code against an interface that provides a method to let us calculate things.\n",

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nBy sending headers inadvertently, you might have introduced a security vulnerability: say, you are doing a redirection, but hence the headers are already sent, the redirection does not work and the rest of the page might be output, thus the visitor may see what she was not supposed to see. While this can be mitigated by using exit, you know the story, only if every one of us utilize good programming habits every time.\nEven if letting the visitor stay in the wrong page does not have a security implication, by breaking a session behavior, or in some other ways I&#39;ve encountered over years, the security and/or session cycle might have taken some sort of blow in the end.\nIf not security, you may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after ?&gt;. An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

Back references are evil, or at least very difficult to implement in the general case, and it&#39;s not easy to recognize not-general cases.\n\nIn your case, the problem is that the regex&#39;s first match will be from the first  to the last . That&#39;s not what you intended, but it is the way regexes work. (The &quot;longest left-most rule&quot;.) In theory, it&#39;s still possible to match the regex without killing the stack, but I doubt whether the regex library you&#39;re using is clever enough to make that optimization.\n\nYou can fix the regex to match what you want it to match by making the data part () non-greedy: change it to . That might also fix the stack blow-up problem, because it will cause the regex to match much earlier, before it blows up the stack. But I don&#39;t know if it will work in general; I really don&#39;t know anything about the MS implementation.\n\nIn my opinion, you should avoid back references, even though it means complicating your code a bit. What I would do is to first match:\n\n\n\nand then create the terminating string:\n\n\n\nand then  the terminating string. That means you can no longer use the regex library&#39;s iterator, which is unfortunate, but the loop is still pretty straight-forward.\n\nBy the way, I find it odd that you only recognize the start delimiter if it is at the end of a line, and the end delimiter if it is at the start of a line. My inclination would have been to require both of them to be full lines. If you replace the regex-with-back-reference with my two-step approach, it&#39;s relatively easy to accomplish that.

However, determining whether a regexp has a string that it matches is np-hard[1]. This is only feasible if you know in advance what kind of regexes you&#39;ll be getting.\n\nThe next best best method in the  class is  or . However, we need to parse the regex if we do this.\n\nI can&#39;t speak for the future, but as of Ruby 2.0, there is no better method in the  core class.\n\nA left parenthesis denotes a literal left parenthesis, if preceded by an unescaped backslash. A backslash is unescaped unless an unescaped backslash precedes. So, a character is escaped iff preceded by an odd number of backslashes. \n\nAn unescaped left parenthesis denotes a capturing group iff not followed by a question mark. With a question mark, it can mean various things:  and  denote a named capturing group. Named and unnamed capturing groups cannot coexist in the same regex, however[2].  denote non-capturing groups. This is a special case of .  denote atomic groups. , ,  and  denote lookaround.  denote comments.\n\nRuby regexp engine supports comments in regexes. Considering them in the main regex would be very difficult. We can try to strip them if we really want to support these, but supporting them fully will get messy due to the possibility of inline flags turning extended mode (and thus line comments) on and off in ways that a regular expression cannot capture. I will go ahead and not support unescaped parentheses in regex comments[3].\n\nWe want to count:\n\n\nthe number of left parentheses \nthat are not escaped by a backslash  (read: not preceded by an odd number of backslashes that are not preceded by yet another backslash) and \nthat are not followed by a question mark \n\n\nRuby doesn&#39;t support unbounded lookbehind, but if we reverse the source first, we can rewrite the first assertion slightly: . The second assertion becomes a lookbehind: . \n\nthe whole solution\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: we can show the NP-hardness by converting the satisfiability problem to it:\n\n\nAND:  ( must be an assertion)\nOR: \nNOT: \natoms: , , , ..., , ...\n\n\nexample(XOR): \n\nthis extends to NP-completeness for any class of regexes that can be tested in polynomial time. This includes any regex with no nested repetition (or repeated backreferences to repetition or recursion) and with bounded nesting depth of optional matches.\n\n[2]:  returns , indicating that unnamed capturing groups are ignored when named capturing groups are present. Tested in Ruby 1.9.3\n\n[3]: Inline comments start with  and end with . They cannot contain an unescaped right parenthesis, but they can contain an unescaped left parenthesis. These can be stripped easily (even though we have to sprinkle the &quot;unescaped&quot; regex everywhere), are the lesser evil, but they&#39;re also less likely to contain anunescaped left parenthesis.\n\nLine comments start with  and end with a newline. These are only treated as comments in the extended mode. Outside the extended mode, they match the literal  and newline. This is still easy, even if we have to consider escaping again. Determining if the regex has the extended flag set is not too difficult, but the flag modifier groups are a different beast entirely.\n\nEven with Ruby&#39;s awesome recursive regexes, merely determining if a previously-open group modifying the extended mode is already closed would yield a very nasty regex (even if you replace one by one and don&#39;t have to skip comments, you have to account for escaping).

            "body": "UPDATE\n\nSo I am still messing with this, and have gotten as far as finding all the instances of tags, though I&#39;d rather JUST find the deepest stacked instance, as life would be easier that way.. Anyway here is what I got..\n\n\n\nAre there ANY regexp guru&#39;s out there that could give me some pointers or a regexp that mimics what I need? Which is only getting the deepest stacked instance of a {{tag}} that ends like this {{//tag}}\n\nORIGINAL\n\nOk, so I have an issue I have seen others have, but with a different approach to it.. Or so I thought.. So I am curious if anyone else can help me solve this issue further..\n\nI have a database full of templates that I need to work with in PHP, these templates are made and used by another system, and so there for can not be changed. With that said, these templates have hierarchy style tags added to them. What I need to do, is get these templates from the database, and then programmatically find these tags, their function name (or tag name), and their inner contents, as well as anything following the function (tag) name within the brackets.. An example of one of these tags is, {{FunctionName some (otherStuff) !Here}} Some content sits inside and it ends {{/FunctionName}}\n\nThis is where it gets more fun, the templates have another random tag, which I am guessing are the &quot;variable&quot; style of these tags, as they are always generally the same syntax. Which looks like this, ${RandomTag}, but also there are times that the function style one is there but without an ending tag, like so.. {{RandomLoner}}\n\nExample Template...\n\n\n\nOk so in no way is this a real template, but it follows all the rules that I have seen thus far.\n\nNow I have tried different things with regex and preg_match_all to pull out the matches, and get each of these into a nice array. So far what I have got is this (used it on the example template to make sure its working still)\n\n\n\nI have tried a couple approaches, (that took me nearly 8 hours to get to)\n\n\n\nIn no way am I a guru with regexp, I actually just learned it over the last day or so, trying to get this to work. I have googled for this, and realize that regexp is not designed for nested stuff, but the (?R) seems to do the trick on simple bracket examples Ive seen on the internets, but they always only take into account of the stuff between the { and } or ( and ) or &lt; and &gt;. After reading nearly the whole regex info website, and playing, I came up with these 2 versions.\n\nSo what I NEED to do (I think), would have a regexp work from the DEEPEST hierarchy tag first, and work its way out (if I can do that with help from php, thats fine with me). I was thinking finding the Deepest layer, get its data, and work backwards til all the contents are in 1 fat array. I assumed that was what the ($R) was going to do for me, but it didn&#39;t.\n\nSo any help on what I am missing would be great, also take into note that mine seems to have issues with {{}} that DONT have an ending version of it. So like my {{Random}} example, was removed for the sake of me parsing the array example. I feel these tags, along with the ${} tags can be left alone (if I knew how to do that with regexp), and just remain in the text where they are. I am more or less interested in the functions and getting their data into a multidimensional array for me to work with further.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just have been banging me head all night with this. I started with the assumption that it was going to be a bit easier.. Til I realized the tags where nested :/\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thanks!\n",

My regexes are mostly working, although they are in places slurping too much text into my named groups.  Take the following regex for example:\n\n\n\nThe performer group includes the string  as well as the performer&#39;s name.  Unfortunately, because the records are not consistently formatted, some performers&#39; names are surrounded by single quotation marks whilst others are not.  This means they are optional as far as the regex is concerned.  \n\nI&#39;ve tried marking the last group as a greedy group using the  group specifier, but this appeared to have no effect on the results.  \n\nI can improve the results by changing the performer group to match a small range of characters, but this reduces my chances of parsing the name out correctly.

Their main problem is that they are like an hammer and when you have them, you try to make all the problems be like a nail. So their main problem is in the user (the programmer).\n\nFirst &quot;big&quot; limitation: Javascript implements only a subset of them, with no Unicode support. Normally the language you use server side has a more complete implementation, so you get limited by js. Even quite complete implementations like the .NET one have big limits: no support for surrogate pairs and no support for &quot;composed&quot; characters (characters that use combining mark). But, as always, the problem is in the programmer. How many programmers that know Unicode know the intricacies of Unicode, of the various sets of digits, of the diacritics?\n\nSecond &quot;big&quot; limitation: maintainability. They are complex and unreadable when they are written. But months later? They get worse! And if you have to train a new programmer, now he has to learn one more language: regex.\n\nThird &quot;big&quot; limitation: they hide too much. You see . What does it means? a digit a space and a digit? Surely. But both  and  in the .NET Regexes &quot;hide&quot; a microworld.  &quot;matches&quot; any non-european digit (and there are many many ones in Unicode).  &quot;matches&quot; so many esoteric spaces of which I don&#39;t even know the name...

            "body": "For what it is worth, most scripting languages (like Perl) and non-static compile-time languages (like Pick) support automatic run-time dynamic String to (relatively arbitrary) object conversions. This CAN be accomplished in Java as well without losing type-safety and the good stuff statically-typed languages provide WITHOUT the nasty side-effects of some of the other languages that do evil things with dynamic casting. A Perl example that does some questionable math:\n\n\n\nIn Java, this is better accomplished (IMHO) by using a method I call &quot;cross-casting&quot;.\nWith cross-casting, reflection is used in a lazy-loaded cache of constructors and methods that are dynamically discovered via the following static method: \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, no built-in Java methods such as Class.cast() will do this for String to BigDecimal or String to Integer or any other conversion where there is no supporting class hierarchy. For my part, the point is to provide a fully dynamic way to achieve this - for which I don&#39;t think the prior reference is the right approach - having to code every conversion. Simply put, the implementation is just to cast-from-string if it is legal/possible.\n\nSo the solution is simple reflection looking for public Members of either:\n\nSTRING_CLASS_ARRAY = (new Class[] {String.class});\n\na) Member member = targetClass.getMethod(method.getName(),STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\nb) Member member = targetClass.getConstructor(STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\n\nYou will find that all of the primitives (Integer, Long, etc) and all of the basics (BigInteger, BigDecimal, etc) and even java.regex.Pattern are all covered via this approach. I have used this with significant success on production projects where there are a huge amount of arbitrary String value inputs where some more strict checking was needed. In this approach, if there is no method or when the method is invoked an exception is thrown (because it is an illegal value such as a non-numeric input to a BigDecimal or illegal RegEx for a Pattern), that provides the checking specific to the target class inherent logic.\n\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\n1) You need to understand reflection well (this is a little complicated and not for novices).\n2) Some of the Java classes and indeed 3rd-party libraries are (surprise) not coded properly. That is, there are methods that take a single string argument as input and return an instance of the target class but it isn&#39;t what you think... Consider the Integer class:\n\n\n\nThe above method really has nothing to do with Integers as objects wrapping primitives ints.\nReflection will find this as a possible candidate for creating an Integer from a String incorrectly versus the decode, valueof and constructor Members - which are all suitable for most arbitrary String conversions where you really don&#39;t have control over your input data but just want to know if it is possible an Integer.\n\nTo remedy the above, looking for methods that throw Exceptions is a good start because invalid input values that create instances of such objects should throw an Exception. Unfortunately, implementations vary as to whether the Exceptions are declared as checked or not. Integer.valueOf(String) throws a checked NumberFormatException for example, but Pattern.compile() exceptions are not found during reflection lookups. Again, not a failing of this dynamic &quot;cross-casting&quot; approach I think so much as a very non-standard implementation for exception declarations in object creation methods.\n\nIf anyone would like more details on how the above was implemented, let me know but I think this solution is much more flexible/extensible and with less code without losing the good parts of type-safety. Of course it is always best to &quot;know thy data&quot; but as many of us find, we are sometimes only recipients of unmanaged content and have to do the best we can to use it properly.\n\nCheers.\n",

I also realized there&#39;d still be problems with other legitimate matches, such as EVIL: .\n\nSo what it appears I really need is the negation of preceding html entities missing a semicolon:\n\n\n\nBut it is still matching and I&#39;m not sure why.\n\nIt would be ideal to still get returned matches that can be replaced wholesale without further inspection, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.

And I am running Selenium, which has an eval() function (the root of all evil) that runs arbitrary lines of javascript. Is there any way I can get the target of this link from the xpath and Selenium, or do I have to find some way to download the entire page source (how do I do this? There was supposed to be a Selenium command to download the entire page source, but I got an &quot;element doesn&#39;t exist&quot; error when I tried running it) and then break out regexes to mess with the entire page source?\n",

The project worked by searching the (very-large) product database for suggest products that matched the text field, but offered a free text option for those customers that could not find the product in question.\n\nOne obvious concern was the opportunity for customers to send rather explicit requests to some unsuspecting customer with the company&#39;s branding sitting around it.\n\nThe project did not go ahead in the end, for various reasons, the profanity aspect being one.\n\nHowever, I&#39;ve come back to thinking about the project and wondering what kinds of validation could be used here. I&#39;m aware of clbuttic which I know is the standard response to any question of this nature.\n\nThe solutions that I considered were:\n\n\nRun it through something like WebPurify\nUse MechanicalTurk\nWrite a regex pattern which looks for the word in the list. A more complicated version of this would consider plurals and past tenses of the word as well.\nWrite an array of suspicious words, and score each one. If the submission goes above a score, the validation fails.\n\n\nSo there are two questions:\n\n\nIf the submission fails, how do you handle it from a UI perspective?\nWhat are the pros and cons of these solutions, or any others that you can suggest?\n\n\nNB - answers like &quot;profanity filters are evil&quot; are irrelevant. In this semi-hypothetical situation, I haven&#39;t decided to implement a profanity filter or been given the choice of whether or not to implement one.

We Python users have trancended mere text manipulation!&quot; but no one is explaining why you&#39;re experiencing this problem.\n\nYour regex is working. It takes any alphabet, whitespace, or hyphen character and turns it into the number . The problem is that it thinks the negative sign in  is &quot;evil text&quot; to turn into a number.\n\nOne way to approach this is to provide an anchor for your regex - Make it match the commas (or beginning/ending of the string) surrounding the text. So it would see  and turn it into  but would see  and know that it&#39;s not text.\n\nAnother approach is to filter based on &quot;does it not contain digits&quot; instead of &quot;does it contain these things I need&quot; - because what if, later, you need to filter out other punctuation marks? Using  would match &quot;things that aren&#39;t digits or commas&quot;, which would turn  into  but keep  the same.\n\nA third approach is to split the string on commas, then test and change each individual segment - probably to see if it contains digits - and then join them back together.\n\nIf you choose the first or second approaches, I leave it up to you to write a regex that either matches a leading comma or the beginning of a string (and a trailing comma or the end of the string - both are similar).

If that&#39;s still the case, here&#39;s what you want:\n\n\n\nAs of right now, I think these are the only regexes posted that allow for less than one letter with the first pattern, and less than two letters with the second pattern.\n\nRegexes are not a &quot;bad&quot; thing, they&#39;re just a specialized tool that isn&#39;t suited for every task. If you&#39;re trying to validate input in ASP.NET, I would definitely use a RegularExpressionValidator for this particular pattern, because otherwise you&#39;ll have to waste your time writing a CustomValidator for a pretty meager performance boost. See my answer to this other question for a little guidance on when and when not to use regex. \n\nIn this case, the reason I&#39;d use a regex validator has less to do with the pattern itself and more to do with ASP.NET. A RegularExpressionValidator can just be dragged and dropped into your ASPX code, and all you&#39;d have to write would be 10-21 characters of regex. With a CustomValidator, you&#39;d have to write custom validation functions, both in the codebehind and the JavaScript. You might squeeze a little more performance out of it, but think about when validation comes into play: only once per postback. The performance difference is going to be less than a millisecond.

            "body": "Overview\n\nAround the end of 2009, I wrote a simple templating system for PHP/HTML to be used in-house by our designers for brochure-ware type websites. The goal of the system is to allow templating in otherwise pure HTML via custom tags that are processed by PHP. For example, a templated page might look like this:\n\n\n\nThe template itself might look something like this:\n\n\n\nBesides the Page and Content/Container tags, there are a few other tags included in the core for stuff like flow control, iterating over a collection, outputting dynamic values, etc. The framework is designed so it&#39;s very easy to add your own set of tags registered under another prefix and namespace.\n\nCustom Tags to PHP\n\nHow do we parse these custom tags? Since the&#39;re no guarantee that the HTML file is well-formed XML, solutions like XSLT/XPATH won&#39;t be reliable. Instead, we use a regex to look for tags with registered prefixes, and replace those with PHP code. The PHP code is a stack-based design... upon encountering an opening tag, an object representing the tag is created pushed onto the stack, and its &quot;initialization function&quot; (if any) runs. Whenever a registered closing tag is encountered, the most recent object is popped off the stack, and its &quot;rendering function&quot; runs.\n\nSo, after the framework replaces the templating tags with PHP, our example page might look something like this (in realty it&#39;s a bit uglier):\n\n\n\nThe good, the bad, and \n\nNow, how to execute our newly-generated PHP code? I can think of a few options here. The easiest is to simply  the string, and that works well enough. However, any programmer will tell you &quot;eval is evil, don&#39;t use it...&quot; so the question is, is there anything more appropriate than  that we can use here? \n\nI&#39;ve considered using a temporary or cached file, using  output streams, etc, but as far as I can see these don&#39;t offer any real advantage over . Caching could speed things up, but in practice all the sites we have on this thing are already blazingly fast, so I see no need to make speed optimizations at this point.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor each of the things on this list: is it a good idea? Can you think of a better alternative?\n\n\nthe whole idea in general (custom tags for html / php)\nconverting tags to php code instead of processing directly\nthe stack-based approach \nthe use of  (or similar)\n\n\nThanks for reading and TIA for any advice. :)\n",

Likewise your valid character sets should also be characters.\n\nYour logic is pretty strangely expressed; you&#39;re not even referencing the specialChars set at all, and the looping logic once you&#39;ve found a match seems odd.  I think this is your bug; the matching seems to be the wrong way round in that if the character matches the first valid char, you set flag to  and continue round the current loop; so it will definitely not match the next valid char and hence you break out of the loop with a  flag.  Always.\n\nI would have thought something like this would be more intuitive:\n\n\n\nThis doesn&#39;t take sequences into account (e.g. the strings &quot;--------**  &quot; and &quot;1&quot; would be valid because all individual characters are valid) but then neither does your original code.  A regex is better because it lets you specify the pattern, I supply the above snippet as an example of a clearer way of iterating through the characters.\n\n*Yes, premature optimization is the root of all evil, but when better, cleaner code also happens to be faster that&#39;s an extra win for free.\n",

When I try to run the script over the 32 quarters (8*4) it randomly errors at one point. I get many &quot;Fractional truncation&quot; errors with a single deadlock mixed in.\nSince the data is significantly large, I can&#39;t find the row that errors. IT WORKS when I redo the exact batch that gave the &quot;fractional truncation&quot; errors and deadlock errors. So there is no way to narrow the batch down to the problem.\nThe process takes several days (an issue for another time) so I can&#39;t monitor until it breaks, manually redo the batch, filter out duplicates, check if everything is in there and restart the other quarters.\nIn detail:\nIn the SQL Server database, I&#39;m reading data from Table A into Python. I&#39;m predicting column X and column Y. I&#39;m dumping the data in table B, which is table A + columns X, Y and Z (timestamp).\nMy analysis:\nSince the column types of the overlapping columns in A and B are the same, these shouldn&#39;t give a problem. In Python, I check for nans, extremes, lengths, and I even regex the floats to see if those fit in a decimal datatype. So those columns should not be an issue. The timestamp is just a date stamp and can be written as well. The X and Y columns are floating values and are also controlled with regex to fit in the decimal(7,2).\nThe issue probably isn&#39;t the data on itself, since the data can be written to the database when I redo the batch manually. What could be causing the fractional truncation? What could cause the deadlock error, is it even relevant? I&#39;m 99.9% sure nobody is reading from this table since I&#39;m one of the few that has access to it, and it&#39;s on the develop server. Is it because when I&#39;m writing those batches SQL Server is doing something on the background while I am writing the next batch to the table?\nAdditional information:\nThe data I&#39;m writing is around 8.5 million rows per quarter and around 14 columns.

Please see S.O. history for what has changed.\nI have spent over a decade developing on various C++ based games both 2D and 3D for a number of different engines both big and small and I have also had a short but rather intense run with Qt5 (1.5 years at the time of writing). So far Qt has blown me away with all its neatly stacked cross-platform and performance features and so I am planning on porting my biggest game project to Qt as soon as time lets me.\nTo be honest I am a bit confused myself as to why Qt is not more prevalent in games. I think the main reason is its rather crooked licensing history together with the fact that it just has not being marketed for use in games. Qt is after all made primarily  to ace at cross-platform UI + real-time graphics on many platforms from  embedded and up. Now that Qt has become it&#39;s own company and with the new QML/QtQuick features maybe there will be a boom of Qt based game soon, who knows? I sure hope more game developers will discover Qt and start using it in their projects.\nTo answer your question, I will try to match the offerings of Qt with the needs of different types of games.\nPerformance graphics for 2D\nIn traditional Qt there exists different abstractions for graphics. For some smaller embedded platforms it can rely on a simple 2D subsystem only. But for most desktop platforms (Windows/MacOSX/Linux) and mobile platforms (Android/OSX) the 2D abstraction rests neatly on top of a high-performance 3D stack based on OpenGL or OpenGL ES respectively.\nThis is a true gem, and makes graphics programming a joy thanks to the well thought out architecture that allows you to chose how high- or low- level you want to approach your graphics programming.\nThere are lots of classes that allow you to go about your drawing as usual with well known concepts like color, line thickness, and shape while knowing that i|t will all be 3D accelerated under the hood.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/graphicsview.html\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/coordsys.html\nThen there is the whole new thing &quot;QtQuick&quot; or &quot;QML&quot;. A declarative language that together with java script provides the quickest and meanest way to chug out interactive UI and games that I know about on this planet. After I managed to make a full flight of piano keys in 5 lines of code and in under 15minutes I was sold.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-index.html\nPerformance graphics for 3D\nQt has traditionally had a very strong bond to OpenGL, and this bond has served Qt very well as OpenGL is portable and performant over a wide range of platforms. However with the realization that OpenGL is showing it&#39;s age, the ever present question of comparability with DirectX on the Microsoft platforms and the advent of new technologies like Vulkan and Metal, the Qt company has made the wise strategic move of generalizing the hardware abstraction layer, and from version 6, Qt now is no longer tied to OpenGL.\nWhile we wait, there is also nothing in Qt to hinder you from using DX together with Qt on the Microsoft platforms. Qt goes to great lengths to not interfere with other libraries on any platform, so it will work with a lot of other toolkits and engines, and you can even embed game engines based on OpenGL inside Qt by exposing Qt&#39;s OpenGL context directly. Also keeping the same code-base for a game that is ported to the two noteworthy mobile platforms with Qt will be much simpler without DX.\nBut, beyond all the convenience classes for managing OpenGL spesific features such as VBO, FBO, loading textures and shaders etc, there really isn&#39;t a full-blown 3D engine anywhere in Qt.\nUPDATE 2016-01-29: Since I first wrote this answer it has come to my atention that there is a great effort being made to provide a full-blown 3D engine in Qt. It is called Qt3D 2.0 and is a complete rewrite of the old Qt3D that was part of Qt4.x and that was part of only one release before it was removed due to political reasons (Nokia ditched Qt).\nIt has an impressive set of features and a lot of good thinking has gone into it&#39;s API to ensure that it can leverage the full potential of modern graphics hardware while staying flexible and performant. Another good news is that is in technology preview. This means that you can try it out today and it will be part of main-line Qt soon. You can read more about it here.\nMath\nAs part of the 3D stack, Qt has a full set of performance math routines such as matrix, vector, quaternions, point, rect etc.\nThe common stl math functions such as sqrt, floor, sin etc. are also wrapped in a platform-independence layer.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtmath.html\nThere are no support for advanced math like full blown physics engine, collision detection or response.\nFor that you might be interested in this:\nhttps://github.com/junggon/gear\nAssets management\nQt has a fully fledged resource management system that compiles resources into your binary. This is cross platform and supports any file type you need with special support for common image formats, svg, sounds, fonts, HTML, CSS. And loading and using resources is really simple since all of Qt&#39;s file handlign orutines accept URLs that point to these resources. Really awesome.\nUser interfaces\nGUI code is Qt&#39;s forte. It has great tools for working with GUIs that for some small&#39;ish 2D games will actually be usable as level editors.\nCross platform support\nUPDATE 2016-01-29: It is part of the core values for Qt to be platform agnostic. Qt supports the major desktop platforms, the major mobile platforms and a bunch of embedded hardware that you never heard of.  Please see the official list of community supported (free/open source) platforms here. It will allow you to bring your mostly unchanged code base to all platforms you like, saving you a lot of time, money and effort the day you decide to make the &quot;iOS version&quot;.\nPlatform integration\nQt has wrapped all platform integration in a cross-platform way. This includes:\n\nLauncher icons\nConfiguration file (with properly abstracted platform specifics like location and format)\nPopups\nClipboard management\nDrag and drop\nFullscreen/imersive mode switching.\nMultiple display support\nTooltips\nPlatform look and feel\n\n2D Animation\nQt features a full framework for working with state machines. On top of this there sits a full framework for animating properties that can be used for making interactive UI in 2D (or even 3D if you play your cards right). It has all the stuff you expect like easing, automatic state transition and tons of convenience wrappers and ways of doing interresting stuff. It&#39;s like working with jQuery but in C++. For some games, this is all you need.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-statesanimations-animations.html\nContainers\nQt has a bunch of STL like container classes with extensions to accommodate Qt specific features. These classes include everything from Lists to maps to arrays and buffers.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/containers.html\nStrings\nQt&#39;s string class is my favourite of any language. It has its quirks, but it gives you a ton of performance and features, and as usual its cross-platform together with all it&#39;s friends:\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/string-processing.html\nTimers, threads and events\nThe whole of Qt framework is implemented around an asynchronous architecture based on event-loops with light-weight events called &quot;signals&quot;.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-syntax-signals.html\nQt supports multiple levels of concurrency from low-level threads, through managed thread pools to modern map-reduce and &quot;futures&quot;. It also has cross-platform high-performance locking mechanism such as mutecies, locks, wait conditions, lock free stuff, atomic operations and a whole bunch of other stuff that I didn&#39;t get a chance to check out yet.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/examples-threadandconcurrent.html\nOf course Qt has support for timers that fit well into all this with a lot of convenience features such as adjusting the precision, triggering single-shot etc.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/timers.html\nInput\nInput from touch screens, mice and keyboards is handled using the event architecture, and Qt really has this wrapped up in a basket. There was experimental support for joysticks and gamepads at one point, but it was removed in Qt6.\nBut there are several Qt-aligned project that seem to add joystick/gamepad supoport like this.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/eventsandfilters.html\nThere is also support for sensors like position, pressure, compass, rotation, temperature, so you can make never-ball clones too.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtsensors-index.html\nAnd there is support for blue-tooth for connecting and sharing game data over the air without access to wifi.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtbluetooth-index.html\nAnd there is camera support for whatever you might want to use that for in a game.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cameraoverview.html\nAll cross-platform.\nScripting\nQt has an embedded high-performance ECMA (a.k.a. java script) engine tied into its core. Oh and you get a tightly embedded port of google web-kit included as well, if you need it.\nhttps://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtjavascript.html\nMedia playback\nQt wraps gstreamer and other media libraries to support play back of media such as video and sound. It allows the developer to chose on which level they want to intearact with media. On the high level you can just put a widget and run .play() on the low level you get access to buffers of video and audio for your processing pleasure.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/multimediaoverview.html\nMedia encoding\nDepending on the active back-end Qt also gives you access to encode streams to network/disk etc.\nUtility classes\nWhere do I start?\n\nMD5/SHA other secure hash algorithms\nCompression/decompression algorithms\nEncryption/decryption algorithms\nFile handling both blocking, non-blocking, mapped etc.\nFile system handling such as copy, move, rename of files\nFile alteration monitoring\nHTTP client\nHigh performance socket programming\nSynthetic UI events generation\nTime and date\nDNS access\nLogging\nError messages\nMIME and URL processing\njson parser/generator\nGesture recognition\nCompiled regex\nSerial IO\nXML parser/generator\nSSL\nUndo/Redo\n\nThe list really goes on and on... See for your self here:\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/classes.html\nInternationalization\nOut-of-the-box internationalization through the use of ICU with all the advanced features such as RTL support in text widgets etc.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/internationalization.html\nUpdates / plug-ins\nQt has a plug-in architecture. That means you can split your executable into bits and update them separately, reloading each bit dynamically at run-time.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/plugins-howto.html\nUnit testing\nQt has it very own unit testing framework built right in. What sets it apart is that it is tightly integrated with Qt and supports visual testing of user interfaces. You can simulate key-presses and mouse clicks, check for the presence of widgets and states etc.\nIt also has modes for profiling, bench-marking, data-driven testing and more.\nThis post is getting kind of long so I won&#39;t go into more detail.\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qttest-index.html\nStability\nQt was first released in 1995 and has thus had a long time to stabilize. It has a huge set of regression tests that is run before every release and it is thoroughly tested on a bunch of compilers, platforms and devices. For some reason this is not on the top of many game developer&#39;s lists.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Qt_releases\nDocumentation\nQt has really good documentation, and it is continuously improving. If you clicked some of my links you would already know.\nCommunity\nSince Qt has been around for so long a large community of experienced users has formed. You will find blog posts, wikis and forums in many languages and rich with knowledge of any kind of issue you might be working with. Here is a list:\nhttps://wiki.qt.io/Online_Communities\nThis turned out to be one hell of a long post with mostly Qt PROs, but I figure this is what it takes to judge a platform before you test it out. Good luck on your project!\n",

Similar for defining IpAddress as any word composed of digits and &quot;.&quot;. If the re&#39;s you are comparing to are as tolerant of badly formatted data, then I&#39;m sure they will be fast.\nOn my machine, pyparsing parses 1000 elements per second, so about 40 seconds for your list of 40,000 elements. If you are processing that router output once a day, 40 seconds seems fast enough. If you are doing it once a minute, then pyparsing will not be the right tool.\n\n",

            "body": "Hotspot vs. Vulnerability\nFirst of all note that SonarQube is informing you about a security hotspot, not a vulnerability. What that means is (quoting from the docs):\n\nA Security Hotspot highlights a security-sensitive piece of code that the developer needs to review. Upon review, you&#39;ll either find there is no threat or you need to apply a fix to secure the code.\n[...]\nWith a Hotspot, a security-sensitive piece of code is highlighted, but the overall application security may not be impacted. It&#39;s up to the developer to review the code to determine whether or not a fix is needed to secure the code.\n\nThe important takeaway here is that SonarQube is not telling you that there is something wrong. It&#39;s telling you that you should look carefully at the code to determine whether something is wrong.\nIn other words it&#39;s telling you that your regex may be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, not that it actually is. If you review the code and determine that there is no vulnerability, it is perfectly fine to just dismiss the issue without changing anything.\nSo why exactly is SonarQube telling you to review this code?\nSonarQube doesn&#39;t actually detect whether a regular expression is vulnerable to ReDoS or not (that&#39;s why it&#39;s labelled as a security hotspot, not a vulnerability). Instead it flags all non-trivial regular expressions and reminds you to review them to determine whether they&#39;re vulnerable or not. As explained in the documentation of the rule, it considers any regex as non-trivial that contains more than one occurrence of any of the characters .\nSince both of your regular expressions are non-trivial by that criteria, both are flagged.\nUpdate: The above applies to the ReDoS rule that was around when this answer was written. This rule has been deprecated in the mean time and replaced with a new rule that should only complain about regular expressions that actually have a superlinear runtime. The new rule does not complain about the regex in this question.\nSo is your code vulnerable?\nNo, neither of your regular expressions are vulnerable. In fact the only repetition operator used in either expression is  and since you provide an upper bound in all cases, there isn&#39;t even any unbounded repetition.\nHowever, I&#39;d say your first regex is complicated enough to be a readability and maintenance nightmare. So you should consider replacing it with another approach (such as splitting the string into individual numbers and checking that each number is in the desired range).\nSo what should you do?\nHaving determined that the regular expressions are not vulnerable, you should dismiss the hotspot.\nIn the comments it was pointed out, that the message will go away if you split the regex string into multiple concatenated strings or move it into a variable. The reason that works is simply that it tricks SonarQube into not finding the regex. So that change wouldn&#39;t make your code any better or safer, it would just confuse SonarQube and is in no way preferable to just dismissing the message. It is generally not advisable to obfuscate your code just to make your static analysis tools shut up.\n",

            "body": "Why Are Evil Regexes A Problem?\nBecause computers do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it&#39;s not what you meant or is totally unreasonable. If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

It&#39;s to understand the structure for a project of this scale, which involves IO and Exception handling.\nSo, I&#39;ve been debugging this snippet of code since yesterday. I&#39;ve identified the problem, but have not been able to solve it.\nI currently have an infinite loop after the exception message is printed. For context, in the part of the code that is missing, the user inputs the number of files and it creates an array of files. The snippet of code inside my message is a method which verifies if a csv has a an empty field. Count is there to count the line numbers, if count == 1 and there is an empty field, it will throw , which is a custom exception I made for this project. If count is bigger than 1, it throws , i.e. another custom exception.\nThe timeline of the debugging goes as follows:\nAt first, when I had the infinite loop, I thought the regex caused my error, since I heard it could be badly implemented. I checked and each element is exactly what I want (a string, which represents a field in the csv). So, it wasn&#39;t regex since the behavior was normal.\nSecondly, I realized I accidentally put my try block was inside my while loop, so I put it on the outside. No Luck. The issue still persisted.\nThen, I figured out the issue. It read the line handled the exception and since there was no failsafe to exit the while loop, it did so non-stop.  So, I added an exit condition for the while loop. So, I added\n\nThis checks if the line number is higher than 1 and if the nextLine is null or empty. I thought this had solved the infinite loop problem that I had. Once I implemented this, nothind after the regex ended up being outputted. I checked with multiple println().\nI then realized I made a typo in one of the for loops. Now, I&#39;m back to the same behavior it exhibited earlier. It&#39;s redoing the same sequence inside the while loop again. In this case, it&#39;s looping the message from , so i.e. \nSo, I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t make sense logically. I&#39;ve tried multiple solutions and the exceptions are now never reached.\nSorry for the long code, the element that is being repeated is at the bottom, and everything else is inside the while loop, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s something I implemented there.\n\n",

Your comment characters are strings and need to be wrapped in quotes, the quotes are not part of what will be substituted in when toggling comments.\n : Autocommands trigger on different things, in this case, these are triggering when a new file or the read file ends with a certain extension. Once triggered, the execute the following command, which allows us to change the  depending on filetype. There are other ways to do this, but they are more confusing to novices (like me).\n : Functions are declared by starting with  and ending with . Functions must start with a capital. the  ensures that this function overwrites any previous functions defined as  with this version of . Without the , I had errors, but that might be because I was defining new functions through the vim command line.\n : Execute calls a command. In this case, we are executing , which can take a range (by default this is the current line) such as  for the whole buffer or  for the highlighted section.  is regex to match the start of a line followed by any amount of whitespace, which is then appended to (due to ). The  here is used for string concatenation, since  can&#39;t be wrapped in quotes.  allows you to escape character in  that matches the arguments (in this case,  and ) by prepending them with a . After this, we concatenate again with the end of our  string, which has the  flag. This flag lets us fail silently, meaning that if we do not find a match on a given line, we won&#39;t yell about it. As a whole, this line lets us put a comment character followed by a space just before the first text, meaning we keep our indentation level.\n : This is similar to our last huge long command. Unique to this one, we have , which makes sure that we don&#39;t have to escape our , and , which refers to the group we made with our . Basically, we&#39;re matching a line that starts with any amount of whitespace and then our comment character followed by any amount of whitespace, and we are only keeping the first set of whitespace. Again,  lets us fail silently if we don&#39;t have a comment character on that line.\n : this sets a variable much like we did with our comment character, but  refers to the local scope (local to this function).  gets the position of, in this case, the start of our highlighting, and the  means we only care about the line number, not other things like the column number.\n : you know how  works.  checks if the first thing contains the second thing, so we grab the line that we started our highlighting on, and check if it starts with whitespace followed by our comment character.  returns the index where this is true, and  if no matches were found. Since  evaluates all nonzero numbers to be true, we have to compare our output to see if it&#39;s greater than -1. Comparison in  returns 0 if false and 1 if true, which is what  wants to see to evaluate correctly.\n :  means map the following command in visual mode, but don&#39;t map it recursively (meaning don&#39;t change any other commands that might use  in other ways). Basically, if you&#39;re a vim novice, always use  to make sure you don&#39;t break things.  means &quot;I don&#39;t want your words, just your actions&quot; and tells it not to print anything to the command line.  is the thing we&#39;re mapping, which is ctrl+r in this case (note that you can still use C-r normally for &quot;redo&quot; in normal mode with this mapping).  is kinda confusing, but basically it makes sure you don&#39;t lose track of your visual highlighting (according to this answer it makes your command start with  which is what we want).  here just tells vim to execute the function we named, and  refers to hitting the  button. We have to hit it once to actually call the function (otherwise we&#39;ve just typed  on the command line, and we have to hit it again to get our substitutes to go through all the way (not really sure why, but whatever). \n\n\nAnyway, hopefully this helps. This will take anything highlighted with , , or , check if the first line is commented, if yes, try to uncomment all highlighted lines, and if not, add an extra layer of comment characters to each line. This is my desired behavior; I did not just want it to toggle whether each line in the block was commented or not, so it works perfectly for me after asking multiple questions on the subject. \n",

            "body": "How much work would you like to do to create the code that could figure out what the fix should be? And, will that amount of work be comparable or less to the work required to examine code by hand?\n\nNow, I&#39;m writing all of this having spent quite a bit of time trying to come up with a system to analyze CPAN installer output to figure out what went wrong (a major impetus for CPANPLUS, now relegated to history). It&#39;s easy to tell that something is not right, but beyond that is a lot of suffering.\n\nIn your example, you have an error about an undeclared variable. How does AutoFix know if that should be a package or a lexical variable? You can guess one or the other, but you actually have two big problems:\n\n\nWhat is the intent of the code?\nDoes the code reflect the actual intent?\n\n\nDetermining the intent of the code is often very difficult for even an experienced human programmer to figure out (just read StackOverflow question comments). Compiling code is often not correct code, in the sense that it doesn&#39;t achieve the desired outcome. Furthermore, does the programmer even understand the problem? Does the code the programmer wrote (incorrectly here) reflect the actual work the code should do? It&#39;s difficult for humans in code review to figure this out. Tools like Coverity can guess at problems it knows about, but they aren&#39;t going to be able to correct the code.\n\nBut let&#39;s say that the programmer understands the problem. Have they correctly expressed that? The longer you&#39;ve been programming, the more you lean toward &quot;no&quot;, in general, in my experience.\n\nThis is completely different than the database constraint you mentioned. That&#39;s a narrowly targeted fix for an expected and allowed situation. Consider a different parallel: if the record has a New York area code but a Chicago address, should I fix the city? When I was a younger dumbass, I did a similar thing to a database. It was stupid because I thought I knew something I didn&#39;t, and everyone who understood the situation recognized it immediately. Even then, those sorts of constraints are how we model what we know about the world, not what the world actually is.\n\nNow, to make AutoFix, you need to make something that can look at code, understand it, and figure out what it should do. You can make guesses, but you have no basis for playing the probabilities there.\n\nTechnical matters can&#39;t solve this. AutoFix can undo the work of pragmas such that some classes of errors don&#39;t show up, but so what? The program with an error just continues? How does that help anyone?\n\nNot only that, compilers tend to complain when they realize they can&#39;t parse something. What they complain about is often not the problem. The first thing I teach people while debugging is that they need to look at the statement immediately proceeding the line line number in the error message. Any error message you catch can have a virtually infinite number of causes.\n\nConsider this code, which fails in the same way as your example (same error message) but for a completely different but common reason:\n\n\n\nHow do you figure out what the fix should be? It&#39;s not about declaring .\n\nSo, you now have two cases, and you build that your fixer. Then you encounter another case, so you build that in. And you keep doing this until eventually you have a large dictionary of fixes. Maybe you get a bit crazy and do some machine learning (and wouldn&#39;t a corpus of bad code and resolutions be cool).\n\nBut, the program still can&#39;t continue. It has to start over because it has to at least back up to where it should have done something but didn&#39;t. You can&#39;t merely restart the program because you don&#39;t know if its idempotent. Re-runing the program might redo work it shouldn&#39;t, such as inserting duplicate into databases.\n\nHaving said all that, this sort of thing is related to static analysis and the refactoring browser. Adam Kennedy&#39;s Parse Perl Isolated (PPI) project was a first step into understanding Perl code without compiling it, then move toward the Smalltalk ideal of understanding which parts of code represented the same thing. If you knew that two things named  were the same thing, you could rearrange code dealing with . For example, if you renamed a method from  to , you could immediately know which s you should rename and which belonged to some other class.\n\nAdam wrote Acme::BadExample and challenged anyone to get it to run. He wrote &quot;any given piece of Perl source exists in bizarre pseudo-quantum-like state, in that it demonstrates both duality and indeterminism.&quot;\n\nJos Boumans stepped up and used some mind-bending Perl, which he then showed in Barely Legal XXX Perl, which I think he first presented in 2006. He was amazingly creative in his solutions, and in a way that I wouldn&#39;t want in production code.\n\nPerl doesn&#39;t even know, by design, what type of thing will be in a variable or even that the method you might call on it will exist. In fact, it defers so much to the runtime, trusting that things will be in place by the time you need them, that we often say &quot;only Perl can parse perl&quot;. You literally need to be able to run Perl code to properly compile it since  blocks can affect the parse. For example, a  can define a subroutine with a certain arity. How do you parse ? You have to know what has already been defined.\n\nPerl has other &quot;action at a distance&quot; features that make this even tougher.  redefines CORE features to add extra behavior, but you might not be able to see that in the code. You can set default regex flags (and I&#39;ve seen plenty of big screw ups by people applying  to entire files without checking). \n",

(In fact, my first attempt worked perfectly except for a typo in one of the names.) Moreover, it is reasonably clear by examination exactly what syntax is being parsed. (This assumes some minimal understanding of generative grammars, of course, but the concepts are not particularly difficult and there are many available learning resources.)\nIf you want to add more features in the future, it&#39;s straight-forward to modify. If instead of just reformatting the text, you want to actually make some use of the decomposed structure, that is easily available without much effort.\n\n\nAs with most generated parsers, it has two components: a lexer (or scanner), which decomposes the input into tokens and discards unimportant text such as whitespace, and a parser which analyses the stream of tokens in order to figure out its structure. Normally a parser would construct some kind of data structure representing the input, normally some kind of tree. Here I&#39;ve simplified the process by just recombining the parsed input into a transformed output. (In retrospect, I can&#39;t help thinking that, as usual, it would have been clearer to produce an entire parse tree and then create the output by doing a walk over the tree. Perhaps as penance I&#39;ll redo it later.)\n\nHere&#39;s the scanner. The only meaningful tokens are the punctuation symbols and what I&#39;ve called WORDs, which are sequences of whatever Python considers word characters (usually alphabetic and numeric characters plus underlines), without distinguishing between purely alphabetic, purely numeric, and mixed tokens as in your question.\n\n\n\nNow the parser. The grammar for sequences is a little redundant because it has to special-case a sequence of one item: Since the grammar also explicitly inserts parentheses around  as it parses, it would be incorrect to add them around the entire sequence. But if the entire sequence is one item, the original parenthweses have to be reinserted. For sets, things are much clearer; the elements are not modified at all, the braces must always be added back.\n\nHere&#39;s the entire grammar:\n\n\n\nAnd here&#39;s the implementation, with the grammar repeated, Ply-style, as docstrings:\n\n\n\nNow, a (very) simple driver:\n\n\n",

I suggest you write a directive that listens to input/keydown/paste events and that uses a regex to only allow float/integer numbers.\nThe following regex () allows a number to begin with an optional  followed by digits, then a comma or dot and more digits.\nIf the new value (current value + key pressed) does not match the regex, simply prevent the event from happening with . Otherwise, do nothing and let the value go to the input.\nNote that you also have to take care of the copy/cut/paste/undo/redo special keys. And also take into account the cursor position and the selection if any.\nOnce the filtering is done, you can implement the  interface and bind it to your input via its  events. Do the string to number conversions in these handlers and do the number to string conversion in a getter or a pipe that you bind to the  attribute.\nHere is an example of such a directive, you could generalize it by giving the regex as an input parameter.\n\nAnd a custom input-number component implementing :\n\nThe component can then be used with two-way binding with  or with .

However the high ranking answers are often returning false for common URLs but even worse will freeze your app/page for minutes on even as simple a string as . It&#39;s been pointed out in some of the comments, but most probably haven&#39;t entered a bad value to see it. Hanging like that makes that code unusable in any serious application. I think it&#39;s due to the repeated case insensitive sets in code like . Take out the &#39;i&#39; and it doesn&#39;t hang but will of course not work as desired. But even with the ignore case flag those tests reject high unicode values that are allowed.\n\nThe best already mentioned is:\n\n\n\nThat comes from Github segmentio/is-url. The good thing about a code repository is you can see the testing and any issues and also the test strings run through it.

The repository has been updated and I&#39;m not planning on trying to keep up a mirror here. It&#39;s been broken up into separate tests to avoid RegEx redos which can be exploited for DOS attacks (I don&#39;t think you have to worry about that with client side js, but you do have to worry about your page hanging for so long that your visitor leaves your site).\n\nThere is one other repository I&#39;ve seen that may even be better for isURL at dperini/regex-weburl.js, but it is highly complex. It has a bigger test list of valid and invalid URLs. The simple one above still passes all the positives and only fails to block a few odd negatives like  as well as the special ips.\n\nWhichever you choose, run it through this function which I&#39;ve adapted from the tests on dperini/regex-weburl.js, while using your browser&#39;s Developer Tools inpector.\n\n\n\nAnd then test that string of &#39;a&#39;s.\n\nSee this comparison of isURL regex by Mathias Bynens for more info before you post a seemingly great regex.\n",

Strap in.\n\nWCF Documentation\n\nBefore I start, Microsoft has great docs about WCF here. Check them out if you&#39;re not familiar with WCF like me. This is using a client, not a server. We&#39;re just talking to eBay&#39;s server, not running our own.\n\nStep 0: Ensure that solution builds\n\nBefore the next step, make sure your solution builds. You cannot add a connected service unless it successfully builds.\n\nStep 1: Add connected service\n\nFirst step is to add the service reference to the project and generate the model from eBay&#39;s server. eBay provides WSDL files for this purpose. We specifically want this one. You can use the  tool in Visual Studio to do this. You must have an ASP.NET project selected, then go to . Use the option for . Enter that .wsdl URL in the  box, click , change the namespace to whatever you want, then click . The namespace is purely preference, I made mine . All other settings can be left as their defaults. A box will pop up with a bunch of logging stuff, you can ignore it and wait until it&#39;s finished. There will be a TON of yellow warnings, those can be ignored as well.\n\n(Note: You can also use  to generate the model instead of Visual Studio&#39;s GUI, but I won&#39;t cover that.)\n\nStep 2: Edit service reference file\n\nThe web project should now have a section in Solution Explorer near the top called . There should be a folder within that&#39;s named whatever namespace you provided previously. Inside will be a file called  that contains all of the parsing information for the eBay service. This file is MASSIVE, mine has nearly 122k lines. We need to do a couple of things in here.\n\nWe need to do a couple find/replace operations. To do this, we have to find/replace two strings. Turn on regex in the replace window, then replace  with nothing. This catches the cases where  is one of multiple parameters on the attribute. Then do the same thing, but replace . Doing this breaks one of the classes that I came across, so find the class . It has a field called  and a property called . Delete both of those.\n\nKeep in mind you&#39;ll need to redo these steps if you ever regenerate the service from the server, as that process overwrites .\n\n(Why do this? The eBay WSDL file specifies the order that elements will be in when they&#39;re returned from the API, but they&#39;re not even close to correct. Because of this, almost none of the responses will actually parse properly. We need to remove the order specifications and let the program handle the parsing via name.)\n\nStep 3: Write client wrapper\n\nIt&#39;s possible to work directly with this service, but doing so gets really messy. I therefore wrote a wrapper around the client that simplifies this greatly. Commented code is below, the DI will come in the next step so don&#39;t worry about that. You would need to add a function for each API endpoint that you&#39;ll use.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Set up dependency injection\n\nI use the built-in ASP.NET Core DI, so that needs to be set up. The base eBay client class can be a singleton, but your wrapper class should be scoped.\n\nIn  / :\n\n\n\nStep 5: Call the wrapper in your code\n\nYour controller might look like this:\n\n\n",

Giving the full power of regex to the general public for a website&#39;s search engine could have a devastating effect.  There is such a thing as a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack that should be avoided at all costs.\n\nHTML/XML parsing should not be done with regular expressions.  First of all, regular expressions are designed to parse a regular language which is the simplest among the Chomsky hierarchy.  Now, with the advent of balancing group definitions in the .NET flavor of regular expressions you can venture into slightly more complex territory and do a few things with XML or HTML in controlled situations.  However, there&#39;s not much point.  There are parsers available for both XML and HTML which will do the job more easily, more efficiently, and more reliably.  In .NET, XML can be handled the old XmlDocument way or even more easily with Linq to XML.  Or for HTML there&#39;s the HTML Agility Pack.\n\nConclusion\n\nRegular expressions have their uses.  I still contend that in many cases they can save the programmer a lot of time and effort. Of course, given infinite time &amp; resources, one could almost always build a procedural solution that&#39;s more efficient than an equivalent regular expression. \n\nYour decision to abandon regex should be based on 3 things:\n\n1.) Is the regular expression so slow in your scenario that it has become a bottleneck?\n\n2.) Is your procedural solution actually quicker &amp; easier to write than the regular expression?\n\n3.) Is there a specialized parser that will do the job better?\n",

Greedy modifiers matches all possible and backtracks by demand, allowing efficient matches,\n\nas referenced by Greedy vs. Reluctant vs. Possessive Quantifiers:\n\nA greedy quantifier first matches as much as possible. So the  matches the entire string. Then the matcher tries to match the  following, but there are no characters left. So it &quot;backtracks&quot;, making the greedy quantifier match one less thing (leaving the &quot;o&quot; at the end of the string unmatched). That still doesn&#39;t match the  in the regex, so it &quot;backtracks&quot; one more step, making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again (leaving the &quot;oo&quot; at the end of the string unmatched). That still doesn&#39;t match the  in the regex, so it backtracks one more step (leaving the &quot;foo&quot; at the end of the string unmatched). Now, the matcher finally matches the  in the regex, and the  and the next  are matched too. Success! [...]\n\n\nWhat does this have to do with ?\nIn :\n\n The literal character &quot;a&quot;.\n&#160; &#160;  Zero or more, possessive.\n The literal character &quot;b&quot;.\n\n\nAs referenced by Greedy vs. Reluctant vs. Possessive Quantifiers:\n\nA possessive quantifier is just like the greedy quantifier, but it doesn&#39;t backtrack. So it starts out with  matching the entire string, leaving nothing unmatched. Then there is nothing left for it to match with the  in the regex. Since the possessive quantifier doesn&#39;t backtrack, the match fails there.\n\n\nWhy does it matter?\nThe machine won&#39;t realize if it&#39;s doing an (in)efficient match on its own. See here for a decent example: Program run forever when matching regex. In many scenarios, regexes written quickly may not be efficient and may well easily be problematic in deployment.\nSo what&#39;s an atomic group?\nAfter the pattern within the atomic group finishes matching, it will not let go, ever. Study this example:\n\nLooks perfectly legitimate, but this match fails. The steps are simple: The first alternation of the atomic group matches perfectly -  consumes . The group then completes its match - now here is our pointer location:\n\nThe pattern advances. Now we try to match , but there is no . Instead of trying to backtrack (releasing  and consuming ), the match fails.\nWell that&#39;s a bad idea then! Why would we prevent backtracking, Unihedron?\nNow imagine we&#39;re manipulating with a JSON object. This file is not small. Backtracking from the end is going to be a bad idea.\n\nUh oh...\nDo you get what I mean now? :P\nI&#39;ll leave you to figure out the rest, and try to find out more about possessive quantifiers and atomic groups; I&#39;m not writing anything else into this post.

This is because you used quantifiers that are greedy and not possessive (backtracking).\n\n... Long story short, because the input string fails to match, every quantifier within your regex causes indefinite backtracking - Every character is released from  and then  and then both and then a group is released from  to backtrack more.\nHere&#39;s a few solutions you should follow:\nAvoid abundant quantifiers!\nIf you revise your expression, you&#39;ll see that the pattern is logically same as:\n\nThis uses a step of logical induction to reduce the regex upstairs to match far quicker, now at 97 steps!\n\nUse possessive quantifiers while you can!\nAs I mentioned,  is evil because it backtracks in a terrible manner. We&#39;re in Java, what can we do?\nThis solution works only because  and  matches distinct items. We can use a possessive group!\n\nThese simple &quot;&quot; denotes &quot;We&#39;re not backtracking if we fail the match from here&quot;. This is an extremely effective solution, and cuts off any need for backtracking. Whenever you have two distinct groups with a quantifier in between, use them.

Technically, the first part has an ugly answer, but the second part (as I understand it) has no answer.\n\n\n\nFor your first part, I have a pretty impractical (yet pure regex) answer; anything better would require code (like @rednaw&#39;s much cleaner answer above).  I added to the test to make it more comprehensive.   (For simplicity, I&#39;m using  for PCRE, case insensitive, printing one match per line.)\n\n\n\nI&#39;m basically making a special case for any letter in &quot;ben&quot; so I can include only iterations that are not themselves part of the string &quot;ben.&quot;  As I said, not really practical, even if I am technically answering your question.  I&#39;ve also saved a blow-by-blow explanation of this regex if you want further detail.\n\nIf you&#39;re forced into using a pure regex rather than code, your best bet for items like this is to write code to generate the regex.  That way you can keep a clean copy of it.\n\n\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking for the remainder of your challenge; a regex is either greedy or lazy [1] [2], and I don&#39;t know of any implementations that can find &quot;every combination&quot; rather than merely the first combination by either method.  If there were such a thing, it would be very very slow in real life (rather than quick examples); the slow speed of regex engines would be intolerable if they were forced to examine every possibility, which would basically be a ReDoS.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nI assume you are looking for                  but I don&#39;t think you can get that with a pure regex.

On the editor level, you just need to ensure all text is inside some , and that each of them contains only a single word (splitting it if necessary). On the word level, just listen for changes in the s (binding  and ) and act according to its class/data.\n\nHowever, the real pain is to keep the caret position consistent. When you change the contents of either a  or an element with , the caret moves rather unpredictably, and there&#39;s no easy (cross-browser) way of keeping track of the caret. I searched for solutions both here at SO and elsewhere, and the simplest working solution I found was this blog post. Unfortunatly it only applied to , so the &quot;each word in a span&quot; solution couldn&#39;t be used.\n\nSo, I suggest the following approach:\n\n\nKeep a list of words in an , where each word stores both the current value and the original;\nWhen the contents of the  changes, keep the set of unchanged words and redo the rest;\nOnly apply the spell check if the caret is just after a non-word character (room for improvement) and you&#39;re not hitting ;\nIf the user was unsatisfied with the correction, hitting  once will undo it, and it won&#39;t be checked again unless modified.\n\nIf many corrections were done at once (for instance, if a lot of text were copy-pasted), each  will undo one correction until no one is left.\nHitting any other key will commit the correction, so if the user is still unsatisfied he&#39;ll have to go back and change it again.\nNote: differently from the OP requirements, the changed version will be autocorrected again if the user inputs a non-word character; he&#39;ll need to hit  once to &quot;protect&quot; it.\n\n\n\nI created a simple proof-of-concept at jsFiddle. Details below.

If performance is really a concern, the best test case is the situation where you&#39;re actually going to use your code, not least because of garbage collection and the JIT&#39;er making things unpredictable in terms of the actual performance.\n\nThat said, the  approach in general will be (20-50%) faster than . Memory-wise there shouldn&#39;t be much of a difference - both approaches are creating a new string per character. In addition to that, the  obviously also creates an additional array.\n\nA comparison of these two methods:\n\ncharAt:\n\n\n\nsplit:\n\n\n\nThe relevant compiled ABC byte code is predictably identical between the two, except the call to split, and the array access vs. calling . In other words, no crazy optimization stunts by the ASC compiler (those are rare anyway).\n\n10 runs, 1000 iterations each of the above code, release build on release player:\n\n\n\nAvg = average time for each run (of 1000 iterations)\n\nMin = minimum time for a single run\n\nMax = maximum time for a single run\n\nIter = average time for a single iteration.\n\nThe variance between runs is fairly large, likely due to garbage collection happening during some of the runs. But the result is consistently in favour of . Making the  call once before each run rather than redoing it in each iteration doesn&#39;t make much difference. In other words, the difference in performance really does lie in accessing the array being slower than calling . It&#39;s not the huge difference, however, that you&#39;ll get from, say, using  instead of a regex for searching a string.\n\nIn general, although it&#39;s not a hard-and-fast rule, the most obvious approach to simple tasks like string manipulation will likely be the faster one.

The below regex has the ability to\nformulate a replacement with or without quotes and/or parenthesis,\nor other forms.  \n\nSamples below give ways to formulate replacements.  \n\nVery Important Note here  \n\nIF you are talking about eliminating quotes &quot;&quot; and parenthesis () from the\nmatching regex, that could be done as well. It requires a new regex.  \n\nThe only problem is that ALL distinction between preferred/middle/nick\ngets thrown out the window because these were positional as well as\ndelimited (ie:  (preferred) middle &quot;nick&quot;  ).  \n\nTaking away consideration of that would require regex subexpressions like this  \n\n\n\nAnd, thier being optional, loses all positional reference and renders the midle-initial\nexpression invalid.  \n\nEnd Note  \n\nRegex template (use to formulate replacement strings)  \n\n\n\nVBA regex (2nd edition, tested in my VBA project from above)  \n\n\n\nSample input/output possibilities  \n\n\n\nRe: 4/17 concern  \n\n\n\nActually, no it wouldn&#39;t. In this case, for your form, allowing multiple words in the last name\ninjects the space field delimeter into the last name field.  \n\nHowever, for your particular form, it could be done, since the only handicap is when the\n field is missing. When it is missing and given that there is only one word in the\nmiddle name, 2 permutations are presented.  \n\nHopefully You can get the solution from the 3 regexes and test case output(s) below.\nThe regexes have expunged space delimeters from the capture. So, you can either compose\nreplacements with the Replace method, or just store the capture buffers to compare to\nthe results of capture scenario&#39;s of other columns.\n\n\n",

Column sorting, rows grouping, showing different views of the data without re-running the query (a big time saver when working with gigabytes of logs). Excel style formulas and conditional formatting are also supported.\nSimple interface for building charts and show result in all kinds of chart types (line, pie, bar, column, doughnut, area, 2D and 3D charts, etc…)\nPrint log parser reports\n-Change command line parameters from the GUI\n-Support for multiline (log4net) and regex (regular expressions) input formats and for Т-SQL (OLEDB) queries to maintain your SQL servers from single tool. Also supports Facebook FQL (useful if you are using the tool as Facebook developer).\nInline Visual Basic .Net code (useful for prompting users for input). Change queries using VB.Net code. For instance this query will prompt the user for EventID input (sample from Lizard Labs web site):\n\n\n  select top 100 * from Application  where EventID=&lt;% return\n  Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction.InputBox(&quot;Please enter Event\n  ID&quot;,&quot;Event ID&quot;,&quot;1053&quot;) %&gt;\n\n\n\nAnd if you really like it, for very small price you can have added value and even more features like export results to Excel 2007, create PDF reports, save queries in centralized SQL Server Database for easy shearing among users , etc…\nTherefore I believe that you have made a fine choice using Log Parser Lizard. I believe it is much better software than Microsoft Log Parser Studio and Visual Log Parser or any other logparser GUI I have worked with. \n\nI hope that someday Microsoft will release Logparser 3.0 (that we all love v2.2) supporting more input formats (Exchange, Sharepoint, etc…) and with more powerful features instead of releasing the Log Parser Studio GUI (which is not so bad after all but users have to be informed about better alternatives like Log Parser Lizard here).\n",

This is really cool.\n\n\n\nThe answer to your question about ʀᴏᴍᴀɴ ɴᴜᴍᴇʀᴀʟ ᴏɴᴇ and ʟᴀᴛɪɴ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɪ is YES.  Here’s a quick way to check:\n\n\n\nHowever, the answer to your question as to whether characters that are visually indistinguishable have compatibility equivalence is most definitely NO!\n\nFor example, ᴄʜᴇʀᴏᴋᴇᴇ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɢᴏ (Ꭺ) looks like ʟᴀᴛɪɴ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ᴀ (A), but is certainly not  NFKD equivalent.  Similarly with ɢʀᴇᴇᴋ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ᴀʟᴘʜᴀ (Α) and ᴄʏʀɪʟʟɪᴄ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ᴀ (А) not being NFKD equivalent.  There are effectively uncountably many (well, I can’t count them :) such issues.  The only code points that are NFKD-equiv to ʟᴀᴛɪɴ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ᴀ, for example, are:\n\n\n\nSimilarly, here are the codepoints that are NFKD equiv to the ʟᴀᴛɪɴ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɪ you were looking at:\n\n\n\nNotice there’s no ɢʀᴇᴇᴋ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɪᴏᴛᴀ there, just as one example.\n\nYou can’t use NFKD to find lookalikes, and some things that are NKFD equiv don’t look much alike.  So you can’t do it that way in the general case. It’s not a problem you can even begin to look at without looking at actual fonts.  \n\nI believe ICU has an extended, non-standard property for this, like .  I downloaded their datafiles for this, but haven’t played with it much yet.\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nIt turns out that UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, has exactly what you are looking for.  If you fetch its raw, plaintext datafiles, you will be able to determine which code points are potentially confusable with one another. \n\nFor example, in the text earlier in this message, I enumerated the code points that were NFKD equivalent to ʟᴀᴛɪɴ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɪ, and pointed out that many potential confusables were missing from that set. That’s because the NFKD mapping is not designed to detect confusables.  However, the datafiles from UTS#39 very much are designed for just that very purpose.\n\nTo redo my ʟᴀᴛɪɴ ᴄᴀᴘɪᴛᴀʟ ʟᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɪ enumeration, updating it to handle all code points that UTS#39 deems mutually confusable with it, we have these, formatted using unichars and sorted in order of the Unicode Collation Algorithm using ucsort:\n\n\n\nNifty though that is, it gets even better. The datafiles include not just single-codepoint confusables, but also confusables that may in some cases require multiple code points. For example, here’s one such set, this time in file-native format:\n\n\n\nIsn’t that swell?  The only hitch is unless you use the ICU classes, you’ll have to roll your own from the UTS#39 datafiles.  \n\nSince there are no other language bindings that I am aware of, I’ve added to my ᴛᴏᴅᴏ list to create Perl bindings to mimic the ICU style of writing  in the regex engine.\n\nNote that you may also wish to consider both UTS#36 and UTS#39, which the ICU  class handles for you. It’s specifically for URI-type things (read: Internet identifers, which use a restricted character set), not just any old arbitrary text.\n",

Good discussion: https://plus.google.com/109096274754593704906/posts/R4qkeyRadLR\n\nThis may apply well to you if you want to have some control on what you release. But the fact that your &quot;features&quot; are small, you may relate to this type of workflow.\n\nBranch-per-Feature\n\nThe big WHY: Fast, flexible, high quality and confident development/deployment/testing etc. This makes business happy.\n\nIn point form, unorganized and rough:\n\nFeatures are small\n\nOld-school branch-per-feature meant that branches were large and long living to avoid having to integrate because it was a pain. This was a vicious circle as the feature would diverge further and further from other features or the mainline. Features should be as atomic as possible and your development process should abide by the Open Close Principle. Features should be small.\n\nIntegrate relentlessly\n\nThey should be integrated into an integration branch almost as often as you commit to them. This gives feedback immediately. You have some sort of CI running off of the integration branch to tell you if your changes are not adversely affecting other work. This gives you the immediate feedback of trunk-based integration while keeping your work organized and malleable.\n\nDon&#39;t do back-merges\n\nOr at least avoid them. A back-merge is where you want to use something from the integration branch to help you get your work done on the feature. This is a smell that you don&#39;t have independent stories. A reasonable middle-ground is cherry-picking. A successfully cherry-picked commit will not cause you issues when you merge in the future.\n\nKeeping a feature branch filled with commits that only attain what the feature is supposed to do will make working with it much more flexible.\n\nInvolve QA from the start\n\nThis should not even be a contentious point anymore. We all know how important tight feedback loops are. There should not be a QA department with QA employees. QA should be a hat that is worn at different or same people at different times.\n\nKnowing what your Acceptance Criteria is and how you will prove it from the start is integral to getting a lot of things gelling - including a successful branch-per-feature regiment.\n\nA proper DSL a la Ubiquitous Language (see Domain Driven Design) is at the heart of this. The tool that best communicates across to the Product Owner, Regression/Specification Testing and Behaviour Driven Design feedback is currently StoryTeller. One thing that it offers that no other tools offer is communication to the person writing the Acceptance Tests of what the system is capable of doing with the smallest amount of friction caused by technology. You simply pick what you want to do by clicking on links, filling out text boxes and selecting from drop-downs. There is no guessing as to how a tool might interpret your free-form text with it&#39;s regex and English-parsing goodness.\n\nShare your hard work\n\nThere will be conflicts when you merge. This is a fact of life when work is done by more than one person. When you integrate often from your feature to the integration branch, the conflicts you solve should be remembered. This is done by git&#39;s rerere but could be simulated in other systems with little effort. The key is to set up a way of sharing these auto-resolution conflicts to the rest of the team.\n\nNow anyone that tries to integrate that feature and has that conflict will not have to resolve it. No dev required to put together a build. This is a manual share right now if needed. I should have the script published in about a week that does this behind the scenes. If you want to do it yourself, look no further than the .git/rr-cache folder in your repository. Simple synchronization between all devs is the bare minimum that is needed.\n\nTaking features out is more powerful than putting them in\n\nThis might sound counter-intuitive. But at the end of an iteration, a feature that you thought was done may not work as the last bits of testing on the build as a whole make releasing a no-go. Anyone should be able to take out that feature and release anyway.\n\nSo the trick is not to take the feature out of the build. You make a build with the problem feature omitted. You can integrate that feature in the next iteration when there is time. Releasing a build should be painless.\n\nDon&#39;t make a build to test out of the integration branch. Make a separate branch that can be reset relentlessly and tag release candidates. Reset this branch to the start commit of your iteration and merge all the features you know work.\n\nNo conflicts. Remember rerere and the like? Anyone should be able to do this if you followed the practices here. This is &quot;why&quot; the hard work needs to be shared.\n\nThe key is we &quot;threw away&quot; all previous merges and have to redo them. But remembering our conflict resolutions, this is now a trivial matter. If in doubt, we haven&#39;t really thrown them away, they are still there to reference or use. Git&#39;s pick-axe functionality makes it really easy to find certain code changes if you don&#39;t know where to look.\n\nGiant refactorings\n\nYour work is as organized as is possible. Whether you elect to do this off of a certain point in time on the integration branch, release candidate branch or you started a feature branch for it, you have a way of tracking that work and can apply it as a merge, rebase or manual patch to another point if necessary. \n\nAny hardships that you may encounter will be tempered by the fact that you are relentlessly sharing your conflict resolutions and continuously integrating. PROPER BRANCH-PER-FEATURE RELIES ON RELENTLESS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION\n\nToggles are a hack\n\nThere are exceptions. You&#39;re a giant company. You need to enable a feature for a small subset of early adopter users. This is now an explicit feature that&#39;s important to business. That&#39;s where we all want to be but most of us are not.\n\nHaving to make architectural changes because you can&#39;t effectively organize your work is a process smell plain and simple. Some teams are not mature enough and this may be an OK solution temporarily.\n\nThis is Git Flow Improved\n\nMost of this way of working started from the excellent post called &quot;Git Flow a Successful Branching Strategy&quot;. The important addition to this process is the idea that you start all features in an iteration from a common point. This would be what you released for the last one. This drives home the granular, atomic, flexible nature that features must exhibit for us to deliver to business in the most effective way.\n\nThe other key difference is no back-merge into the feature. Otherwise, you will not be able to exclude this feature later in the iteration.\n\nIt will be bad if you use old tools\n\nNot having a snapshot based history will hurt as branching is effectively copying another branch which will be slow. Not having a base of where the branch originated will make merging difficult as you do not have a base to compare how each side of development has changed. There are many other issues with having a connected-only tool to support what you do in order to work with everyone.\n\nHope this helps!\n",

What is a good way to find and replace chunks of this kind of a file? For example, assume that the above section is repeated a few dozen times and in each chunk the value of the tag  is different.

This approach, IMHO is the most time consuming, error prone and painful method. The absolute last resort.\nRegExes: Use regular expressions to match blocks of interest and edit them using replacement expressions. Kinda like this blog entry: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vseditor/archive/2004/08/12/213770.aspx.

I spend a long time trying to convince both of them working together a while ago but it was a pretty flaky setup. Depending on the order of evaluation of both filters I either get no syntax highlighting or all, escaped HTML output, line breaks disappear or, sometimes, it can indeed work.\n\nI am now at a point where it almost works again, but with exceptions. Ideally GeSHi would take care of the code, while Texy handles the rest, but that&#39;s not the case. The nice regular expression\n\n\n\ngets the part between the first two asterisks italicized, since Texy runs over that part as well. Which is unfortunate, since it changes the meaning of the regex.\n\nAnyone out here who has insights of how to peroperly set up multiple filters for input in Drupal and how to handle non-HTML markup and syntax highlighting simultaneously. As I currently have to go over every post that contains code I have written (nearly all) it wouldn probably not much less work to completely redo every page on the site in search for a better setup. As for syntax highlighting, I have much need for the usual common languages, such as C#, Java, etc. but also for more esoteric ones like Windows batch files or Powershell. Simply dumping unhighlighted code there isn&#39;t very pretty.\n\nSo, actually I have two questions here:\n\n\nHow can one convince multiple input filters to work without interfering with each other, specifically Texy and GeSHI?\nWhat other options are out there that meet my requirements of easy-to-write non-HTML markup1 and syntax highlighting even for lesser-used languages2?\n\n\n\n\n1 Often I just need emphasis and strong emphasis, sometimes headings, often images, sometimes also tables.

            "body": "I&#39;ll answer seriously. I do not know of any program to translate a shell script into Perl, and I doubt any interpreter module would provide the performance benefits. So I&#39;ll give an outline of how I would go about it.\n\nNow, you want to reuse your code as much as possible. In that case, I suggest selecting pieces of that code, write a Perl version of that, and then call the Perl script from the main script. That will enable you to do the conversion in small steps, assert that the converted part is working, and improve gradually your Perl knowledge.\n\nAs you can call outside programs from a Perl script, you can even replace some bigger logic with Perl, and call smaller shell scripts (or other commands) from Perl to do something you don&#39;t feel comfortable yet to convert. So you&#39;ll have a shell script calling a perl script calling another shell script. And, in fact, I did exactly that with my own very first Perl script.\n\nOf course, it&#39;s important to select well what to convert. I&#39;ll explain, below, how many patterns common in shell scripts are written in Perl, so that you can identify them inside your script, and create replacements by as much cut&amp;paste as possible.\n\nFirst, both Perl scripts and Shell scripts are code+functions. Ie, anything which is not a function declaration is executed in the order it is encountered. You don&#39;t need to declare functions before use, though. That means the general layout of the script can be preserved, though the ability to keep things in memory (like a whole file, or a processed form of it) makes it possible to simplify tasks.\n\nA Perl script, in Unix, starts with something like this:\n\n\n\nThe first line, obviously, points to the commands to be used to run the script, just like normal shells do. The following two &quot;use&quot; lines make then language more strict, which should decrease the amount of bugs you encounter because you don&#39;t know the language well (or plain did something wrong). The third use line imports the &quot;Dumper&quot; function of the &quot;Data&quot; module. It&#39;s useful for debugging purposes. If you want to know the value of an array or hash table, just print Dumper(whatever).\n\nNote also that comments are just like shell&#39;s, lines starting with &quot;#&quot;.\n\nNow, you call external programs and pipe to or pipe from them. For example:\n\n\n\nThat will run cat, passing &quot;&quot;, which would be $1 on shell -- the first argument passed to it. The result of that will be piped into your Perl script through &quot;THIS&quot;, which you can use to read that from it, as I&#39;ll show later.\n\nYou can use &quot;|&quot; at the beginning or end of line, to indicate the mode &quot;pipe to&quot; or &quot;pipe from&quot;, and specify a command to be run, and you can also use &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; at the beginning, to open a file for writing with or without truncation, &quot;&lt;&quot; to explicitly indicate opening a file for reading (the default), or &quot;+&lt;&quot; and &quot;+&gt;&quot; for read and write. Notice that the later will truncate the file first.\n\nAnother syntax for &quot;open&quot;, which will avoid problems with files with such characters in their names, is having the opening mode as a second argument:\n\n\n\nThis will do the same thing. The mode &quot;-|&quot; stands for &quot;pipe from&quot; and &quot;|-&quot; stands for &quot;pipe to&quot;. The rest of the modes can be used as they were (). While there is more than this to open, it should suffice for most things.\n\nBut you should avoid calling external programs as much as possible. You could open the file directly, by doing , for example, and have much better performance.\n\nSo, what external programs you could cut out? Well, almost everything. But let&#39;s stay with the basics: cat, grep, cut, head, tail, uniq, wc, sort. \n\nCAT\n\nWell, there isn&#39;t much to be said about this one. Just remember that, if possible, read the file only once and keep it in memory. If the file is huge you won&#39;t do that, of course, but there are almost always ways to avoid reading a file more than once.\n\nAnyway, the basic syntax for cat would be:\n\n\n\nThis opens a file, and prints all it&#39;s contents (&quot;&quot; will loop until EOF, assigning each line to &quot;&quot;), and close it again.\n\nIf I wanted to direct the output to another file, I could do this:\n\n\n\nThis will print the line to the file indicated by &quot;&quot;. You can use ,  and  in the appropriate places as well, without having to open them first. In fact, &quot;&quot; defaults to , and &quot;&quot; defaults to &quot;&quot;.\n\nNotice also the &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The operators  and  means it will only execute the following command if the first returns false (which means empty string, null reference, 0, and the like). The die command stops the script with an error message.\n\nThe main difference between &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; is priority. If &quot;&quot; was replaced by &quot;&quot; in the examples above, it would not work as expected, because the line would be interpreted as:\n\n\n\nWhich is not at all what is expected. As &quot;&quot; has a lower priority, it works. In the line where &quot;&quot; is used, the parameters to  are passed between parenthesis, making it possible to use &quot;&quot;.\n\nAlas, there is something which is pretty much what cat does:\n\n\n\nThat will print all files in the command line, or anything passed through STDIN.\n\nGREP\n\nSo, how would our &quot;grep&quot; script work? I&#39;ll assume &quot;grep -E&quot;, because that&#39;s easier in Perl than simple grep. Anyway:\n\n\n\nThe &quot;o&quot; passed to $patttern instructs Perl to compile that pattern only once, thus gaining you speed. Not the style &quot;something if cond&quot;. It means it will only execute &quot;something&quot; if the condition is true. Finally, &quot;&quot;, alone, is the same as &quot;&quot;, which means compare $_ with the regex pattern indicated. If you want standard  behavior, ie, just substring matching, you could write:\n\n\n\nCUT\n\nUsually, you do better using regex groups to get the exact string than cut. What you would do with &quot;sed&quot;, for instance. Anyway, here are two ways of reproducing cut:\n\n\n\nThat will get you the fourth column of every line, using &quot;,&quot; as separator. Note  and . The  sigil means &quot;array&quot; should be treated as an, well, array. It will receive an array composed of each column in the currently processed line. Next, the  sigil means  is a scalar value. It will return the column you are asking for.\n\nThis is not a good implementation, though, as &quot;split&quot; will scan the whole string. I once reduced a process from 30 minutes to 2 seconds just by not using split -- the lines where rather large, though. Anyway, the following has a superior performance if the lines are expected to be big, and the columns you want are low:\n\n\n\nThis leverages regular expressions to get the desired information, and only that.\n\nIf you want positional columns, you can use:\n\n\n\nWhich will print 10 characters starting from the sixth (again, 0 means the first character).\n\nHEAD\n\nThis one is pretty simple:\n\n\n\nThings to note here. I use &quot;ne&quot; to compare strings. Now, $ARGV will always point to the current file, being read, so I keep track of them to restart my counting once I&#39;m reading a new file. Also note the more traditional syntax for &quot;if&quot;, right along with the post-fixed one.\n\nI also use a simplified syntax to get the number of lines to be printed. When you use &quot;shift&quot; by itself it will assume &quot;shift @ARGV&quot;. Also, note that shift, besides modifying @ARGV, will return the element that was shifted out of it.\n\nAs with a shell, there is no distinction between a number and a string -- you just use it. Even things like &quot;2&quot;+&quot;2&quot; will work. In fact, Perl is even more lenient, cheerfully treating anything non-number as a 0, so you might want to be careful there.\n\nThis script is very inefficient, though, as it reads ALL file, not only the required lines. Let&#39;s improve it, and see a couple of important keywords in the process:\n\n\n\nThe keywords &quot;next&quot; and &quot;last&quot; are very useful. First, &quot;next&quot; will tell Perl to go back to the loop condition, getting the next element if applicable. Here we use it to skip a file unless it is truly a file (not a directory) and readable. It will also skip if we couldn&#39;t open the file even then.\n\nThen &quot;last&quot; is used to immediately jump out of a loop. We use it to stop reading the file once we have reached the required number of lines. It&#39;s true we read one line too many, but having &quot;last&quot; in that position shows clearly that the lines after it won&#39;t be executed.\n\nThere is also &quot;redo&quot;, which will go back to the beginning of the loop, but without reevaluating the condition nor getting the next element.\n\nTAIL\n\nI&#39;ll do a little trick here.\n\n\n\nOk, I&#39;m combining &quot;push&quot;, which appends a value to an array, with &quot;shift&quot;, which takes something from the beginning of an array. If you want a stack, you can use push/pop or shift/unshift. Mix them, and you have a queue. I keep my queue with at most 10 elements with  which will give me the index of the last element in the array. You could also get the number of elements in  with .\n\nUNIQ\n\nNow, uniq only eliminates repeated consecutive lines, which should be easy with what you have seen so far. So I&#39;ll eliminate all of them:\n\n\n\nNow here I&#39;m keeping the whole file in memory, inside . The use of the  sigil indicates this is a hash table. I&#39;m using the lines as keys, and storing nothing as value -- as I have no interest in the values. I check where the key exist with &quot;defined($lines{$_})&quot;, which will test if the value associated with that key is defined or not; the keyword &quot;unless&quot; works just like &quot;if&quot;, but with the opposite effect, so it only prints a line if the line is NOT defined.\n\nNote, too, the syntax  as a way to store something in a hash table. Note the use of  for hash table, as opposed to  for arrays.\n\nWC\n\nThis will actually use a lot of stuff we have seen:\n\n\n\nThree new things. Two are the &quot;+=&quot; operator, which should be obvious, and the &quot;for&quot; expression. Basically, a &quot;for&quot; will assign each element of the array to the variable indicated. The &quot;my&quot; is there to declare the variable, though it&#39;s unneeded if declared previously. I could have an @array variable inside those parenthesis. The &quot;keys %lines&quot; expression will return as an array they keys (the filenames) which exist for the hash table &quot;%lines&quot;. The rest should be obvious.\n\nThe third thing, which I actually added only revising the answer, is the &quot;grep&quot;. The format here is:\n\n\n\nIt will run &quot;code&quot; for each element of the array, passing the element as &quot;$_&quot;. Then grep will return all elements for which the code evaluates to &quot;true&quot; (not 0, not &quot;&quot;, etc). This avoids counting empty strings resulting from consecutive spaces.\n\nSimilar to &quot;grep&quot; there is &quot;map&quot;, which I won&#39;t demonstrate here. Instead of filtering, it will return an array formed by the results of &quot;code&quot; for each element.\n\nSORT\n\nFinally, sort. This one is easy too:\n\n\n\nHere, &quot;sort&quot; will sort the array. Note that sort can receive a function to define the sorting criteria. For instance, if I wanted to sort numbers I could do this:\n\n\n\nHere &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; receive the elements to be compared. &quot;&quot; returns -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the number is less than, equal to or greater than the other. For strings, &quot;cmp&quot; does the same thing.\n\nHANDLING FILES, DIRECTORIES &amp; OTHER STUFF\n\nAs for the rest, basic mathematical expressions should be easy to understand. You can test certain conditions about files this way:\n\n\n\nI&#39;m not trying to be exaustive here, there are many other such tests. I can also do &quot;glob&quot; patterns, like shell&#39;s &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot;, like this:\n\n\n\nIf you combined that with &quot;chdir&quot;, you can emulate &quot;find&quot; as well:\n\n\n\nHere we see, finally, a function. A function is declared with the syntax:\n\n\n\nStrictly speakings, &quot;(params)&quot; is optional. The declared parameter I used, &quot;&quot;, means I&#39;m receiving two scalar parameters. I could have &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; in there as well. The array &quot;&quot; has all the parameters passed. The line &quot;&quot; is just a simple way of assigning the first two elements of that array to the variables  and .\n\nThis function does not return anything (it&#39;s a procedure, really), but you can have functions which return values just by adding &quot;&quot; to it, and have it return &quot;something&quot;.\n\nThe rest of it should be pretty obvious.\n\nMIXING EVERYTHING\n\nNow I&#39;ll present a more involved example. I&#39;ll show some bad code to explain what&#39;s wrong with it, and then show better code.\n\nFor this first example, I have two files, the names.txt file, which names and phone numbers, the systems.txt, with systems and the name of the responsible for them. Here they are:\n\nnames.txt\n\n\n\nsystems.txt\n\n\n\nI want, then, to print the first file, with the system appended to the name of the person, if that person is responsible for that system. The first version might look like this:\n\n\n\nThis code won&#39;t work, though. Perl will complain that the function was used too early for the prototype to be checked, but that&#39;s just a warning. It will give an error on line 8 (the first while loop), complaining about a readline on a closed filehandle. What happened here is that &quot;&quot; is global, so the function  is changing it. Let&#39;s rewrite it, fixing both things:\n\n\n\nThis won&#39;t give any error or warnings, nor will it work. It returns just the sysems, but not the names and phone numbers! What happened? Well, what happened is that we are making a reference to &quot;&quot; after calling , but, by reading the file,  is overwriting the value of !\n\nTo avoid that, we&#39;ll make  local inside . This will give it a local scope, and the original value will then be restored once returned from :\n\n\n\nAnd that still doesn&#39;t work! It prints a newline between the name and the system. Well, Perl reads the line including any newline it might have. There is a neat command which will remove newlines from strings, &quot;&quot;, which we&#39;ll use to fix this problem. And since not every name has a system, we might, as well, avoid printing the comma when that happens:\n\n\n\nThat works, but it also happens to be horribly inefficient. We read the whole systems file for every line in the names file. To avoid that, we&#39;ll read all data from systems once, and then use that to process names.\n\nNow, sometimes a file is so big you can&#39;t read it into memory. When that happens, you should try to read into memory any other file needed to process it, so that you can do everything in a single pass for each file. Anyway, here is the first optimized version of it:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn&#39;t work. No system ever appears! What has happened? Well, let&#39;s look into what &quot;&quot; contains, by using :\n\n\n\nThe output will be something like this:\n\n\n\nThose  is how  displays a hash table. The odd numbers are the keys, and the succeeding even numbers are the values. Now we can see that each name in  has a preceeding space! Silly regex mistake, let&#39;s fix it:\n\n\n\nSo, here, we are aggressively removing any spaces from the beginning or end of name and system. There are other ways to form that regex, but that&#39;s beside the point. There is still one problem with this script, which you&#39;ll have seen if your &quot;names.txt&quot; and/or &quot;systems.txt&quot; files have an empty line at the end. The warnings look like this:\n\n\n\nWhat happened here is that nothing went into the &quot;&quot; variable when the empty line was processed. There are many ways around that, but I choose the following:\n\n\n\nThe regular expressions now require at least one character for name and system, and we test to see if &quot;&quot; is defined before we use it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWell, then, these are the basic tools to translate a shell script. You can do MUCH more with Perl, but that was not your question, and it wouldn&#39;t fit here anyway.\n\nJust as a basic overview of some important topics, \n\n\nA Perl script that might be attacked by hackers need to be run with the -T option, so that Perl will complain about any vulnerable input which has not been properly handled. \nThere are libraries, called modules, for database accesses, XML&amp;cia handling, Telnet, HTTP &amp; other protocols. In fact, there are miriads of modules which can be found at CPAN.\nAs mentioned by someone else, if you make use of AWK or SED, you can translate those into Perl with A2P and S2P.\nPerl can be written in an Object Oriented way.\nThere are multiple versions of Perl. As of this writing, the stable one is 5.8.8 and there is a 5.10.0 available. There is also a Perl 6 in development, but experience has taught everyone not to wait too eagerly for it.\n\n\nThere is a free, good, hands-on, hard &amp; fast book about Perl called Learning Perl The Hard Way. It&#39;s style is similar to this very answer. It might be a good place to go from here.\n\nI hope this helped.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nI&#39;m NOT trying to teach Perl, and you will need to have at least some reference material. There are guidelines to good Perl habits, such as using &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; at the beginning of the script, to make it less lenient of badly written code, or using STDOUT and STDERR on the print lines, to indicate the correct output pipe.\n\nThis is stuff I agree with, but I decided it would detract from the basic goal of showing patterns for common shell script utilities.\n",

If that doesn&#39;t,\nREMOVE THE BINARY because the program is badly behaved.\nAs a general principle we don&#39;t use Unix Railgun to trim the hedges.  https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#kill\nExplanation of above command:\n produces a list of process id&#39;s on the computer visible to this user.  The pipe grep filters that down for rows containing that string.  The  says don&#39;t match on the process itself doing the grepping.  The pipe awk print says split the rows on default delimiter whitespace and filter to the second column which is our process id.  The pipe xargs spins up a new process to send all those pid&#39;s to , ending them all.\nWhy  is bad, dangerous, ugly and hackish:\n\nThere&#39;s a small possibility that you will accidentally end the operating system or cause undefined behavior in an unrelated process, leading to whole system instability because  lists thousands of processes, and you can&#39;t be sure some 3rd party process shares your process name, or that in the time between read and execute kill -9, the processid had changed to something else, and now you&#39;ve ended some random necessary process unrelated to yours.\n\nIf the code being force-ended is doing any database ops or secure transactions with low probability race conditions, some fraction of a percent of the time, atomicity of that transaction will be wrecked, producing undefined behavior.  kill -9 takes no prisoners.  If your code is sensitive to this, try replacing the  part with a transmitted flag that requests a graceful shutdown, and only if that request is denied, last-resort to \n\n\nBut, if you understand all the risks and control for them with unique names, and you&#39;re ok with a few dropped transactions or occasional corruption, then 99.9% of the time yer gonna be fine. If there&#39;s a problem, reboot the computer, make sure there aren&#39;t any process collisions.  It&#39;s because of code like this that makes the tech support script: &quot;Have you tried restarting your computer&quot; a level 5 meme.  &quot;A Rogue Robot scraped  to find integers and sent those to , so reboot the computer to clear the problem.\nWhy not just use  which is easier?\nThe above gives me manual control because , , ,  and  are multi-platform standard.

            "body": "I know how terribly wrong it is to (attempt to) parse HTML with Regex, which is why I&#39;m trying really, really hard to avoid it.\n\nI have an app that generates HTML emails. We&#39;re using a big fancy WYSIWYG drop in email editor that takes care of generating responsive emails and also generates the abysmal markup for clients like MS Outlook. It does that last bit using conditional comments, which look something like the following. Note that the  has an  attribute, and wraps the  tag that non-mso clients will see.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one of dozens (possibly hundreds?) of possible formattings that we need to work with.\n\nPrior to the introduction of this editor, we asked our customers to generate their own HTML emails with a more rudimentary WYSIWYG HMTL editor; but it was incumbent on them to make responsive templates and test their content in various clients. From their perspective, this new editor is a huge win.\n\nAs we&#39;re sending emails, it&#39;s important to track the link clicks via a tracking link that redirects through to the originally-intended link.\n\nTo date, we&#39;ve used jSoup to parse the email content, looking for any anchor tags and replace their href attribute contents. Because regex html parsing is evil, right?\n\nConditional comments have thrown a wrench in those gears.\n\nBecause they are comments, jSoup ignores them, and clicks from MS Outlook and other clients that handle the  markup haven&#39;t been transformed to go through our link tracker, so the clicks don&#39;t get tracked. This is a problem for us.\n\n\n\nFirst idea: replace the conditional comments with a custom tag\n\nAt first I was hopeful to pre-process the message body before letting jSoup have it. I would replace  with  and  with . This was simple enough to do, even for complex forms of the conditions inside the comments. I used a regex to make some simple replacements:\n\n\n became \n became  \netc\n\n\nNotice that I url-encoded the original comment in its entirety. url-encoding it made sure that I could easily use regex to find my marker comments and transform them back (so that I didn&#39;t have to worry about  inside the &quot;orig&quot; attribute content...\n\nThis started to break down when I realized there were multiple possible ways the comments could be closed. I spent a little bit of time working on a similar approach for the closing tags.\n\n\n became \nsame approach for  and \n\n\nI don&#39;t know if you can have attributes on a closing tag. I never tested it because I had another realization before I got to that point. The realization was that using  wasn&#39;t going to produce desirable output from jSoup because the resulting INPUT would often look like:\n\n\n\nThis is not tidy HTML and jSoup will try to correct it, changing the order of tags to make something that it thinks is more correct. When I realized that, I stopped what I was doing and started thinking about the problem again.\n\n\n\nSecond idea: the same thing, but with comments\n\nIf the (new) problem was that jSoup didn&#39;t like my tag nesting, what if I could expose the HTML from inside the conditional comments as if it weren&#39;t commented out, but keep some markers in as comments that I can later transform back into comments? The goal was to aim at making this:\n\n\n\nThis should parse as fairly tidy HTML, right? So I made the code modifications and gave it a shot.\n\nSadly, the documents that we&#39;re working with are far more complex than the simple example I started from above. Here&#39;s the first few lines of an actual sample document:\n\n\n\nAfter the comment conversion, we&#39;ve effectively dropped an  block into the  block, of which jSoup is decidedly not a fan. This is what I get back for the above input, after converting the conditional comments into my plain marked comments, parsing with jSoup, and then converting my markers back to their conditional comments:\n\n\n\nThere are some big problems here. The  block gets basically immediately closed. The  tag moves up to before the  block, and everything that came after it moved down into the body. This isn&#39;t going to work.\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\nI feel like we&#39;re basically out of options. \n\n\nDo nothing and just don&#39;t count the clicks from MS Outlook/etc clients. In some cases we might be able to detect a click anyway via a downstream conversion on that email. (Even if we don&#39;t have record of you clicking the link, if you made a payment then we know you got there...)\nWe could let our mail provider do the link tracking for us (experimentation required; not positive they would track the  links either). Historically we started this system with a provider that didn&#39;t offer link tracking so we had to roll our own. Current provider offers it, but we&#39;ve got years of existing code and processes that would have to be updated to support this change. We&#39;re keeping it in our back pocket if we can&#39;t figure something else out, but the prospect of changing ships mid-stream is ... not appealing.\nOr lastly... maybe... regex? (/me ducks) We could let jSoup do its thing for the normal HTML, and then use regex to replace any links that remain. This becomes a game of whack-a-mole with current and future markup. What might we run into aside from a  in the future? &#175;\\_(ツ)_/&#175; And we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing without regular manual reviews.\n\n\nUnless there&#39;s another option that we haven&#39;t explored yet. So... are we stuck with nothing/regex?\n\nWe&#39;re on the JVM so anything Java is within reach, I guess.\n",

            "body": "The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Solution for Removing &quot;.html&quot; in NGINX:\nUPDATED ANSWER: This question piqued my curiosity, and I went on another, more in-depth search for a &quot;holy grail&quot; solution for  redirects in NGINX. Here is the link to the answer I found, since I didn&#39;t come up with it myself: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32966347/4175718\nHowever, I&#39;ll give an example and explain how it works. Here is the code:\n\nWhat&#39;s happening here is a pretty ingenious use of the  directive. NGINX runs a regex on the  portion of incoming requests. The regex checks if the URI has an .html extension and then stores the extension-less portion of the URI in the built-in variable .\nFrom the docs, since it took me a while to figure out where the  came from:\n\nRegular expressions can contain captures that are made available for later reuse in the $1..$9 variables.\n\nThe regex both checks for the existence of unwanted .html requests and effectively sanitizes the URI so that it does not include the extension. Then, using a simple  statement, the request is redirected to the sanitized URI that is now stored in .\nThe best part about this, as original author cnst explains, is that\n\nDue to the fact that $request_uri is always constant per request, and is not affected by other rewrites, it won&#39;t, in fact, form any infinite loops.\n\nUnlike the rewrites, which operate on any  request (including the invisible internal redirect to ), this solution only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.\nWhat does &quot;try_files&quot; do?\nYou will still need the  directive, as otherwise NGINX will have no idea what to do with the newly sanitized extension-less URIs. The  directive shown above will first try the new URL by itself, then try it with the &quot;.html&quot; extension, then try it as a directory name.\nThe NGINX docs also explain how the default  directive works. The default  directive is ordered differently than the example above so the explanation below does not perfectly line up:\n\nNGINX will first append  to the end of the URI and try to serve it. If it finds an appropriate  file, it will return that file and will maintain the extension-less URI. If it cannot find an appropriate  file, it will try the URI without any extension, then the URI as a directory, and then finally return a 404 error.\n\nUPDATE: What does the regex do?\nThe above answer touches on the use of regular expressions, but here is a more specific explanation for those who are still curious. The following regular expression (regex) is used:\n\nThis breaks down as:\n: indicates beginning of line.\n: match the character &quot;/&quot; literally. Forward slashes do NOT need to be escaped in NGINX.\n: capturing group: match any character an unlimited number of times\n: match the character &quot;.&quot; literally. This must be escaped with a backslash.\n: match the string &quot;html&quot; literally.\n: match a literal &quot;?&quot; or the end of the string. This is done to avoid mishandling file names with something after &quot;.html&quot;.\nThe capturing group  is what contains the non-&quot;.html&quot; portion of the URL. This can later be referenced with the variable . NGINX is then configured to re-try the request () and the  directive internally re-appends the &quot;.html&quot; extension so the file can be located.\nUPDATE: Retaining the query string\nTo retain query strings and arguments passed to a  page, the  statement can be changed to:\n\nThis should allow requests such as  to redirect to  instead of just .\n\nNote that this is considered safe usage of the `if` directive.\nFrom the NGINX page If Is Evil:\n\nThe only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:\nreturn ...;\nrewrite ... last;\n\n\nAlso, note that you may swap out the &#39;302&#39; redirect for a &#39;301&#39;.\nA  redirect is permanent, and is cached by web browsers and search engines. If your goal is to permanently remove the  extension from pages that are already indexed by a search engine, you will want to use a  redirect. However, if you are testing on a live site, it is best practice to start with a  and only move to a  when you are absolutely confident your configuration is working correctly.\n",

However, software engineers have added many extensions that take these implementations far beyond the formal definition. So, while most regular expression engines resemble one another, there is actually no standard. For this reason, a lot depends on what language, API, framework or library you are using.\n(Incidentally, to help reduce confusion, many have taken to using &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot; to describe these enhanced matching languages. See Is a Regex the Same as a Regular Expression? at RexEgg.com for more information.)\nThat said, most regex engines (actually, all of them, as far as I know) would accept . Most likely, there&#39;s an issue with escaping.\nThe Trouble with Escaping\nSome languages have built-in support for regexes, such as JavaScript. For those languages that don&#39;t, escaping can be a problem.\nThis is because you are basically coding in a language within a language. Java, for example, uses  as an escape character within it&#39;s strings, so if you want to place a literal backslash character within a string, you must escape it:\n\nHowever, regexes also use the  character for escaping, so if you want to match a literal  character, you must escape it for the regex engine, and then escape it again for Java:\n\nIn your case, you have probably not escaped the backslash character in the language you are programming in:\n\nAll this escaping can get very confusing. If the language you are working with supports raw strings, then you should use those to cut down on the number of backslashes, but not all languages do (most notably: Java). Fortunately, there&#39;s an alternative that will work some of the time:\n\nFor a regex engine,  and  mean exactly the same thing. Note that this doesn&#39;t work in every case, like newline (), open square bracket () and backslash ( or ).\nA Note about Matching Numbers\n(Hint: It&#39;s harder than you think)\nMatching a number is one of those things you&#39;d think is quite easy with regex, but it&#39;s actually pretty tricky. Let&#39;s take a look at your approach, piece by piece:\n\nMatch an optional  or \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\n\nMatch an optional \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\nFirst, we can clean up this expression a bit by using a character class shorthand for the digits (note that this is also susceptible to the escaping issue mentioned above):\n = \nI&#39;m going to use  below, but keep in mind that it means the same thing as . (Well, actually, in some engines  will match digits from all scripts, so it&#39;ll match more than  will, but that&#39;s probably not significant in your case.)\nNow, if you look at this carefully, you&#39;ll realize that every single part of your pattern is optional. This pattern can match a 0-length string; a string composed only of  or ; or, a string composed only of a . This is probably not what you&#39;ve intended.\nTo fix this, it&#39;s helpful to start by &quot;anchoring&quot; your regex with the bare-minimum required string, probably a single digit:\n\nNow we want to add the decimal part, but it doesn&#39;t go where you think it might:\n\nThis will still match values like . Worse, it&#39;s got a tinge of evil about it. The period is optional, meaning that you&#39;ve got two repeated classes side-by-side ( and ). This can actually be dangerous if used in just the wrong way, opening your system up to DoS attacks.\nTo fix this, rather than treating the period as optional, we need to treat it as required (to separate the repeated character classes) and instead make the entire decimal portion optional:\n\nThis is looking better now. We require a period between the first sequence of digits and the second, but there&#39;s a fatal flaw: we can&#39;t match  because a leading digit is now required.\nThis is actually pretty easy to fix. Instead of making the &quot;decimal&quot; portion of the number optional, we need to look at it as a sequence of characters: 1 or more numbers that may be prefixed by a  that may be prefixed by 0 or more numbers:\n\nNow we just add the sign:\n\nOf course, those slashes are pretty annoying in Java, so we can substitute in our long-form character classes:\n\nMatching versus Validating\nThis has come up in the comments a couple times, so I&#39;m adding an addendum on matching versus validating.\nThe goal of matching is to find some content within the input (the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;). The goal of validating is to ensure that the input is in an expected format.\nRegexes, by their nature, only match text. Given some input, they will either find some matching text or they will not. However, by &quot;snapping&quot; an expression to the beginning and ending of the input with anchor tags ( and ), we can ensure that no match is found unless the entire input matches the expression, effectively using regexes to validate.\nThe regex described above () will match one or more numbers within a target string. So given the input:\n\nThe regex will match , , ,  and .\nTo validate that a given input is a number and nothing but a number, &quot;snap&quot; the expression to the start and end of the input by wrapping it in anchor tags:\n\nThis will only find a match if the entire input is a floating point number, and will not find a match if the input contains additional characters. So, given the input , a match will be found, but given  no matches will be found.\nNote that some regex engines have a ,  or similar function, which essentially does what I&#39;ve described automatically, returning  if a match is found and  if no match is found. Also keep in mind that some engines allow you to set flags which change the definition of  and , matching the beginning/end of a line rather than the beginning/end of the entire input. This is typically not the default, but be on the lookout for these flags.\n",

            "body": "You can read this blog post that explains what most C# MIME parsers get wrong and why MimeKit can handle multiple charset encodings.\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/time-for-rant-on-mime-parsers.html\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-decoding-rfc2047-encoded-headers-is.html\nTime for a rant on mime parsers...\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\nWhere should I begin?\nI guess I should start by saying that I am obsessed with MIME and, in particular, MIME parsers. No, really. I am obsessed. Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ve written and/or worked on several MIME parsers at this point. It started off in my college days working on Spruce which had a horrendously bad MIME parser, and so as you read farther along in my rant about shitty MIME parsers, keep in mind: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve written a shitty MIME parser.\nAs a handful of people are aware, I&#39;ve recently started implementing a C# MIME parser called MimeKit. As I work on this, I&#39;ve been searching around on GitHub and Google to see what other MIME parsers exist out there to find out what sort of APIs they provide. I thought perhaps I&#39;ll find one that offers a well-designed API that will inspire me. Perhaps, by some miracle, I&#39;d find one that was actually pretty good that I could just contribute to instead of writing my own from scratch (yea, wishful thinking). Instead, all I have found are poorly designed and implemented MIME parsers, many probably belong on the front page of the Daily WTF.\nI guess I&#39;ll start with some softballs.\nFirst, there&#39;s the fact that every single one of them was written as  parsers. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ones claiming to be &quot;stream parsers&quot;, because all any of those did was to slap a  on top of the byte stream and start using . What&#39;s so bad about that, you ask? For those not familiar with MIME, I&#39;d like for you to take a look at the raw email sources in your inboxes particularly if you have correspondence with anyone outside of the US. Hopefully, most of your friends and colleagues are using more-or-less MIME compliant email clients, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find at least a few emails with raw 8bit text.\nNow, if the language they were using was C or C++, they might be able to get away with doing this because they&#39;d technically be operating on byte arrays, but with Java and C#, a &#39;string&#39; is a unicode string. Tell me: how does one get a unicode string from a raw byte array?\nBingo. You need to know the charset before you can convert those bytes into unicode characters.\nTo be fair, there&#39;s really no good way of handling raw 8bit text in message headers, but by using a  approach, you are really limiting the possibilities.\nNext up is the  approach. One of the 2 early parsers in GMime (pan-mime-parser.c back in the version 0.7 days) used a  approach, so I understand the thinking behind this. And really, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this approach as far as correctness goes, it&#39;s more of a &quot;this can never be fast&quot; complaint. Of the two early parsers in GMime, the pan-mime-parser.c backend was horribly slow compared to the in-memory parser. Of course, that&#39;s not very surprising. More surprising to me at the time was that when I wrote GMime&#39;s current generation of the parser (sometime between v0.7 and v1.0), it was just as fast as the in-memory parser ever was and only ever had up to 4k in a read buffer at any given time. My point is, there are far better approaches than  if you want your parser to be reasonably performant... and why wouldn&#39;t you want that? Your users definitely want that.\nOkay, now come the more serious problems that I encountered in nearly all of the mime parser libraries I found.\nI think that every single mime parser I&#39;ve found so far uses the &quot;String.Split()&quot; approach for parsing address headers and/or for parsing parameter lists on headers such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition.\nHere&#39;s an example from one C# MIME parser:\n\nHere&#39;s how this same parser decodes encoded-word tokens:\n\nWhat?! It completely throws away the charset in each of those encoded-word tokens. In the case of quoted-printable tokens, it assumes they are all ASCII (actually, latin1 may work as well?) and in the case of base64 encoded-word tokens, it assumes they are all in UTF-7!?!? Where in the world did he get that idea? I can&#39;t begin to imagine his code working on any base64 encoded-word tokens in the real world. &#129318;‍♂️\nI&#39;d just like to point out that this is what this project&#39;s description states:\nA small, efficient, and working mime parser library written in c#.\n...\nI&#39;ve used several open-source mime parsers before, but they all either\nfail on one kind of encoding or the other, or miss some crucial\ninformation. That&#39;s why I decided to finally have a go at the problem\nmyself.\nI&#39;ll grant you that his MIME parser is small, but I&#39;d have to take issue with the &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;working&quot; adjectives. With the heavy use of string allocations and regex matching, it could hardly be considered &quot;efficient&quot;. And as the code pointed out above illustrates, &quot;working&quot; is a bit of an overstatement.\nFolks... this is what you get when you opt for a &quot;lightweight&quot; MIME parser because you think that parsers like GMime are &quot;bloated&quot;.\nOn to parser #2... I like to call this the &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; approach:\n\nI&#39;ll give this guy some credit, at least he saw that his  approach was flawed and so tried to compensate by piecing Humpty Dumpty back together again. Of course, with his String.Trim()ing, he just won&#39;t be able to put him back together again with any level of certainty. The white space in those quoted tokens may have significant meaning.\nMany of the C# MIME parsers out there like to use Regex all over the place. Here&#39;s a snippet from one parser that is entirely written in Regex (yea, have fun maintaining that...):\n\nLet&#39;s pretend that the regex pattern strings are correct in their definitions (because they are god-awful to read and I can&#39;t be bothered to double-check them), the replacing of &#39;_&#39; with a space is wrong (it should only be done in the &quot;q&quot; case) and the  is just evil. Not to mention that there could be multiple encoded words per field.Body which this code utterly fails to handle.\nGuys. I know you love regular expressions and that they are very very useful, but they are no substitute for writing a real tokenizer. This is especially true if you want to be lenient in what you accept (and in the case of MIME, you really need to be).\n",

            "body": "Why Are Evil Regexes A Problem?\nBecause computers do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it&#39;s not what you meant or is totally unreasonable. If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

If you have only a limited number of possible functions, the safest thing to do is to simply map them, and then separate the wanted function and the arguments in the variable, using an array instead. More on that later.\nIf you wanted to provide a generic means for calling functions, you could for example:\n\nI&#39;m using  here, since  is a language statement and not a function, and therefore wouldn&#39;t work like this. If you had to echo here, you&#39;d have to make your own echo wrapper function, like , and call that instead.\nOr, for more readable code, you could list the array as:\n\nIf you needed multiple arguments, you could use this structure:\n\nWhere the arguments listed in the arguments array, unpacked with the splat operator, are in the same order as the target function&#39;s arguments.\nThere are of course only a limited number of useful functions that will directly output anything. Therefore, in the above example we capture the result from  instead and then echo; this simply to illustrate the basic use of variable functions and arguments.\nThis approach will however provide unhinged access to any function in your system, and as such shouldn&#39;t be used on anything but data/calls from trusted sources (you). Allowing users to provide any commands will open up your system to a world of mischief and misery.\nTherefore, my initial recommendation of providing a map of functions. You could:\n\nHave an array with a list of allowed core functions,\nHave an array with a list of your custom wrapper functions, or\nCheck for valid wrapper functions named with a prefix\n\nYou could for example implement wrappers as follows:\n\nThis would give you control over what&#39;s executed, and also whether values are returned or output, etc. pre/post-process. And then iterate your variable commands as follows:\n\nFor an additional layer of insulation, create a class with your custom calls as its methods, instead of polluting the global space with more functions. Ciykd use a public router method that handles no-match cases; calling e.g. , where  returns the  methods.\nI often do something like this when I need to map user requests to class public methods that return output; named e.g. ,  etc. and  for a fallback for unmatched requests.

            "body": "PEP 585 -- Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections claims usability under both Python 3.7 and 3.8 with a standard  preamble. Notably:\n\nFor use cases restricted to type annotations, Python files with the  future-import (available since Python 3.7) can parameterize standard collections, including builtins.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, when  is used, function and variable annotations can parameterize standard collections directly. Example:\n\n\nWhile the above toy example does technically parse, that&#39;s about all it does. Attempting to actually use a parametrized builtin collection at runtime under either Python 3.7 or 3.8 invariably raises the dreaded  exception:\n\nNote the  statement is the standard idiom for resolving PEP 563-style postponed annotations at runtime. Don&#39;t even get me started on PEP 563.\nwho you gonna believe: me or your lying PEP?\nThis discourages the devout Pythonista in me. PEP 585 repeatedly claims that it preserves runtime usability:\n\nPreserving the generic type at runtime enables introspection of the type which can be used for API generation or runtime type checking. Such usage is already present in the wild.\n\n\nJust like with the  module today, the parameterized generic types listed in the previous section all preserve their type parameters at runtime:\n\n\nOf course, none of the above works under Python 3.7 or 3.8 – regardless of whether  is enabled or not:\n\nSo PEP 585 blatantly breaks the wild and all existing attempts to introspect generic types at runtime – especially from runtime type checkers. The entire &quot;Parameters to generics are available at runtime&quot; section is a charade.\nAm I missing something painfully obvious or are parametrized builtin collections the poison pill they superficially appear to be? Since evaluating these collections at runtime under Python 3.7 and 3.8 unconditionally raises exceptions, they&#39;re unusable at runtime – rendering them not simply useless but directly harmful for the widespread use case of type introspection and especially runtime type checking.\nbetween a rock and a hard PEP\nAny codebase type-hinting with parametrized builtin collections will be fundamentally incompatible with runtime type checkers under Python 3.7 and 3.8. Codebases preferring runtime to static type checking while preserving backward compatibility with Python &lt; 3.9 (which has yet to even be officially released as of this writing) thus have no choice but to avoid parametrized builtin collections entirely.\nExcept that too is infeasible. Why? Because PEP 585 deprecates the entire hierarchy of  pseudo-containers:\n\nImporting those [e.g., , , ] from  is deprecated. Due to PEP 563 and the intention to minimize the runtime impact of , this deprecation will not generate . Instead, type checkers may warn about such deprecated usage when the target version of the checked program is signalled to be Python 3.9 or newer. It&#39;s recommended to allow for those warnings to be silenced on a project-wide basis.\n\n\nThe deprecated functionality will be removed from the  module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0.\n\nConsider , for example. By 2025 (or shortly thereafter),  and thus  goes away. But  isn&#39;t safely parametrizable under Python 3.7 and 3.8, because doing so renders your project incompatible with anything that introspects types. So  isn&#39;t a viable option, either.\nSo there are no forward- and backward-compatible options. Instead, either:\n\nProhibit type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) entirely by just preferring builtin containers (e.g., ) to  pseudo-containers (e.g., ) or...\nSupport type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) by either:\n\nPreferring  pseudo-containers to builtin containers until 2025. At that time, both the project in question and all downstream projects of that project will need to be refactored as follows:\n\nDrop Python 3.7 and 3.8 support.\nReplace all  pseudo-containers with builtin containers.\n\n\nImmediately dropping Python 3.7 and 3.8 support by preferring builtin containers to  pseudo-containers. This has the distasteful disadvantage of requiring a currently unstable Python interpreter, but... that&#39;s technically an option. Somehow.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, there are no good options – only a spectrum of increasingly horrifying lessers of several malignant evils. One would hope that PEP authors would actually test their implementations at runtime. Yet, here we are, adrift without a paddle in a steaming cesspit of theorycrafted anti-APIs. Welcome to Python.\nbut that&#39;s not all\nThere is technically a third way. It&#39;s even more distasteful – but it should technically work. One awful theorycrafting deserves another, I always say!\nSince PEP 563-driven postponed annotations are merely strings, type introspection could cleverly run a regex-based replacement on each type being introspected. For each type that is a postponed annotation, globally replace each substring referencing a parametrized builtin container (e.g., ) in that annotation string with the corresponding substring referencing a parametrized  pseudo-container (e.g., ).\nThe result? A Python 3.7- and 3.8-compatible postponed annotation string safely evaluatable until 2025, at which point that internal replacement (and Python 3.7 and 3.8 support) could just be quietly dropped.\nThat&#39;s a totally cray-cray ludicrous speed kludge for the stars, but... that would probably work. The core issue, of course, is that one shouldn&#39;t need insane hackery just to comply with core official PEPs. But there&#39;s an even deeper underlying cultural issue underneath that technical issue. No one – neither the author of PEP 585 nor any of the commentators reviewing PEP 585 – actually tested their new hypothetical proposed functionality before deprecating the existing well-tested functionality that actually worked.\nCore official PEPs should just work out of the box. Increasingly, they don&#39;t. And that should concern everyone.\n",

Probably a better solution is to compose these strings into a series of regexes.

I suspect that unless you&#39;re dealing with tens of thousands of rigs or unless performance is a critical aspect of this application, a naive O(n^2) solution would probably suffice.  (Remember that premature optimization is the root of all evil!)  A simple benchmark would bear this out.\n\nAn even-better solution -- and potentially faster -- would be to set up an elasticsearch instance, but once again that may be too much effort to go to when a naive approach would suffice in a fraction of the implementation time.\n",

If you omit line addresses (numeric, regular expressions, or a combination of both), then the entire file is processed.\n\nPoint 1:\n\nIf you only want to target the first line, then you should specify it explicitly.\n\n\n\nHowever, since you are trying to rid your files of &quot;evil&quot;, you probably want to remove &quot;evil&quot; anywhere (globally) it is found on the first line.\n\n\n\nPoint 2:\n\nThe &quot;evil&quot; you are dealing with uses non-alpha numeric characters, so you must be wary of using it as input in various contexts. In order to use a regular expression to search for regular expression meta-characters (?, +, *, [, ], ., et al), you must either:\n\n\nEscape the meta-characters with backslashes to avoid pattern\ncollisions (Example: ), or\nChange the regular expression pattern delimiter to avoid a pattern collision, or\nBoth (This is what you should do in this case).\n\n\nIn sed, you can change the regex pattern delimiter by escaping a character before your pattern begins.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nPoint 3:\n\nYou can search for strings as a  with regular expressions in sed! By definition, the most basic pattern is a sequence of characters. However, you must adhere to point number two above and escape any regex meta-characters, or the default pattern delimiter, /, if necessary.\n\nSolution 1:\n\nYour evil, I mean regex pattern, has regex meta-characters and the default pattern delimiter embedded in it!\n\n\n\nI would prescribe the following. Notice that I am now using double quotes because I want the shell to do variable interpolation before executing .

            "body": "Oh Yes You Can Use Regexes to Parse HTML!\nFor the task you are attempting, regexes are perfectly fine!\nIt is true that most people underestimate the difficulty of parsing HTML with regular expressions and therefore do so poorly.\nBut this is not some fundamental flaw related to computational theory. That silliness is parroted a lot around here, but don’t you believe them.\nSo while it certainly can be done (this posting serves as an existence proof of this incontrovertible fact), that doesn’t mean it&#160;should&#160;be.\nYou must decide for yourself whether you’re up to the task of writing what amounts to a dedicated, special-purpose HTML parser out of regexes. Most people are not.\nBut I am. ☻\n\nGeneral Regex-Based HTML Parsing Solutions\nFirst I’ll show how easy it is to parse arbitrary HTML with regexes. The full program’s at the end of this posting, but the heart of the parser is:\n\nSee how easy that is to read?\nAs written, it identifies each piece of HTML and tells  where it found that piece. You could easily modify it to do whatever else you want with any given type of piece, or for more particular types than these.\nI have no failing test cases (left :): I’ve successfully run this code on more than 100,000 HTML files — every single one I could quickly and easily get my hands on. Beyond those, I’ve also run it on files specifically constructed to break na&#239;ve parsers.\nThis is not a na&#239;ve parser.\nOh, I’m sure it isn’t perfect, but I haven’t managed to break it yet.  I figure that even if something did, the fix would be easy to fit in because of the program’s clear structure. Even regex-heavy programs should have stucture.\nNow that that’s out of the way, let me address the OP’s question.\nDemo of Solving the OP’s Task Using Regexes\nThe little  program I include below produces the following output, so that you can see that parsing HTML with regexes works just fine for what you wish to do:\n\nParse Input Tags, See No Evil Input\nHere’s the source for the program that produced the output above.\n\nThere you go! Nothing to it! :)\nOnly  you can judge whether your skill with regexes is up to any particular parsing task. Everyone’s level of skill is different, and every new task is different. For jobs where you have a well-defined input set, regexes are obviously the right choice, because it is trivial to put some together when you have a restricted subset of HTML to deal with. Even regex beginners should be handle those jobs with regexes.  Anything else is overkill.\nHowever, once the HTML starts becoming less nailed down, once it starts to ramify in ways you cannot predict but which are perfectly legal, once you have to match more different sorts of things or with more complex dependencies, you will eventually reach a point where you have to work harder to effect a solution that uses regexes than you would have to using a parsing class. Where that break-even point falls  depends again on your own comfort level with regexes.\nSo What Should I Do?\nI’m not going to tell you what you must do or what you cannot do.  I think that’s Wrong. I just want to present you with possibilties, open your eyes a bit. You get to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. There are no absolutes — and nobody else knows your own situation as well as you yourself do. If something seems like it’s too much work, well, maybe it is.  Programming should be fun, you know. If it isn’t, you may be doing it wrong.\nOne can look at my  program in any number of valid ways.  One such is that you indeed can parse HTML with regular expressions. But another is that it is much, much, much harder than almost anyone ever thinks it is. This can easily lead to the conclusion that my program is a testament to what you should not do, because it really is too hard.\nI won’t disagree with that.  Certainly if everything I do in my program doesn’t make sense to you after some study, then you should not be attempting to use regexes for this kind of task. For specific HTML, regexes are great, but for generic HTML, they’re tantamount to madness. I use parsing classes all the time, especially if it’s HTML I haven’t generated myself.\nRegexes  optimal for small HTML parsing problems,  pessimal for large ones\nEven if my program is taken as  illustrative of why you should not use regexes for parsing general HTML — which is OK, because I kinda meant for it to be that ☺  — it still should be an eye-opener so more people break the terribly common and nasty, nasty habit of writing unreadable, unstructured, and unmaintainable patterns.\nPatterns do not have to be ugly, and they do not have to be hard. If you create ugly patterns, it is a reflection on you, not them.\nPhenomenally Exquisite Regex Language\nI’ve been asked to point out that my proferred solution to your problem has been written in Perl. Are you surprised? Did you not notice? Is this revelation a bombshell?\nIt is true that not all other tools and programming languages are quite as convenient, expressive, and powerful when it comes to regexes as Perl is. There’s a big spectrum out there, with some being more suitable than others.  In general, the languages that have expressed regexes as part of the core language instead of as a library are easier to work with. I’ve done nothing with regexes that you couldn’t do in, say, PCRE, although you would structure the program differently if you were using C.\nEventually other languages will be catch up with where Perl is now in terms of regexes.  I say this because back when Perl started, nobody else had anything like Perl’s regexes. Say anything you like, but this is where Perl clearly won: everybody copied Perl’s regexes albeit at varying stages of their development.  Perl pioneered almost (not quite all, but almost) everything that you have come to rely on in modern patterns today, no matter what tool or language you use.  So eventually the others will catch up.\nBut they’ll only catch up to where Perl was sometime in the past, just as it is now.  Everything advances.  In regexes if nothing else, where Perl leads, others follow. Where will Perl be once everybody else finally catches up to where Perl is now?  I have no idea, but I know we too will have moved. Probably we’ll be closer to Perl₆’s style of crafting patterns.\nIf you like that kind  of thing but would like to use it in Perl₅,  you might be interested in Damian Conway’s wonderful Regexp::Grammars module. It’s completely awesome, and makes what I’ve done here in my program seem just as primitive as mine makes the patterns that people cram together without whitespace or alphabetic identifiers.  Check it out!\n\nSimple HTML Chunker\nHere is the complete source to the parser I showed the centerpiece from at the beginning of this posting.\nI am not suggesting that you should use this over a rigorously tested parsing class. But I am tired of people pretending that nobody can parse HTML with regexes just because they can’t. You clearly can, and this program is proof of that assertion.\nSure,  it isn’t easy, but it is possible!\nAnd trying to do so is a terrible waste of time, because good parsing classes exist which you should use for this task.  The right answer to people trying to parse arbitrary HTML is not that it is impossible.  That is a facile and disingenuous answer.  The correct and honest answer is that they shouldn’t attempt it because it is too much of a bother to figure out from scratch; they should not  break their back striving to re&#239;nvent a wheel that works perfectly well.\nOn the other hand, HTML that falls within a predicable subset is ultra-easy to parse with regexes. It’s no wonder people try to use them, because for small problems, toy problems perhaps, nothing could be easier. That’s why it’s so important to distinguish the two tasks — specific vs generic — as these do not necessarily demand the same approach.\nI hope in the future here to see a more fair and honest treatment of questions about HTML and regexes.\nHere’s my HTML lexer.  It doesn’t try to do a validating parse; it just identifies the lexical elements. You might think of it more as an HTML chunker than an HTML parser. It isn’t very forgiving of broken HTML, although it makes some very small allowances in that direction.\nEven if you never parse full HTML yourself (and why should you? it’s a solved problem!), this program has lots of cool regex bits that I believe a lot of people can learn a lot from.

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nYou may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\nFinally, many PHP frameworks including Symfony, Zend and Laravel (there is no mention of this in the coding guidelines but it follows the suit) and the PSR-2 standard (item 2.2) require omission of the closing tag. PHP manual itself (1,2), Wordpress, Drupal and many other PHP software I guess, advise to do so. If you simply make a habit of following the standard (and setup PHP-CS-Fixer for your code) you can forget the issue. Otherwise you will always need to keep the issue in your mind.\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after . An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code. Bonus in bonus: A regex for deleting needless PHP endings: replace  with empty text in all files that contain PHP code.\n\n",

            "body": "There doesn&#39;t seem to be a great answer for this, after trying many things.\nIf there is an answer to the question it might be that there&#39;s no good way to do it. I think it doesn&#39;t hurt to look at potential solutions though and the drawbacks of each one.\n\nSolution 1\n\nUse componentWillUpdate. This is deprecated.\n\nSolution 2\n\nValidate state on render - but in your case and in most others, validation may lead to setState, which react tells you never to do in render(), but doesn&#39;t go into any detail about what will actually happen. Of course, you would have to be careful to prevent infinite loops, but if you call setState in render() upon some condition which cannot logically result in an infinite loop, then what unintended side effects could occur? \n\nSolution 3\n\nAs above, make a wrapper function to both validate and set state. But this is no good in my opinion because any state changes done with set state directly cannot be validated. Not only does setState directly not call your validation, but your validation also does not run on the items in the initial state. You might say, why would you give your component an initial state that&#39;s invalid, but I don&#39;t care, if I want to validate state I want it to validate 50000% of the time and no less.\n\nIn a complex form example, there are other issues with this. What if the validity of one field depends on the state of another field? Surely then, a function to re-validate a field when it changes is not enough. Some people will say to test the field being passed in and dispatch multiple events for re-validation, but again, this just isn&#39;t acceptable to me. Its not fullproof, it can lead to bugs, and make things hard to test. \n\nSolution 4\n\nUse componentWillReceiveProps. Not only is this deprecated, but its also static, meaning that you don&#39;t have access to the component instance. For some components this is fine because you can still modify the state that is returned, but if your component has data outside of state and props then you cannot access it, in addition to not being able to use non-static methods, which in my opinion makes this method pretty useless in many situations.\n\nSolution 5\n\nHaven&#39;t tested this one (bear with me, its fairly nuts), but you can override setState function in your component. Insert a callback into every setState instance. Track how many times setState is called and how many times the setState callback is called. Inside the callback, you can check the two counters stored in the object to see if the last callback is currently running, then, if it is, run one function which validates all state. On render, set both of the counters back down to zero. I don&#39;t recommend this by any means. It may work but its a pretty major hack.\n\nSolution 6\n\nYou can use componentDidUpdate, but this is inefficient. You will be blindly setting state with a value that was not validated then letting your component render only to validate it after and possibly call render again. Once again you have to be careful to avoid infinite loop while calling setState in componentDidUpdate. I read elsewhere that at least if you set the state here, the DOM will only re-draw once. In other words, it doesn&#39;t draw immediately after render() but waits until componentDidUpdate is triggered and re-calls render if state changes in there. This seems like maybe its the only solution I know about that react only warns about without telling you explicitely not to do this. In your case, the efficiency does not matter, but what if the state you were trying to validate was a 100 field form with a very expensive render method. Now, on every key down you&#39;ve essentially doubled the amount of work that react has to do to render your components, causing them to first render without being validated, and then filtering and/or validating them for a very likely second render.\n\nAdditional Issues\n\nIn my case, i&#39;m working on a form and not a simple component like you described above. I may go with a mix of solution 3 and 5. Its more complicated then I want though. It involves using one function to filter, generate errors, and set the state for each field (ie. solution 3). And then on componenetDidUpdate I may look for state keys whose values are different from the last value that the field was validated with. The second step here has many ways of doing so, all of which are messy and inefficient. To make it worse, they practically never run under normal circumstances because I always use the first function to update and validate their state, so this makes testing it harder. It&#39;s like leaving some fallback in my app that seems to work but during the entire development process it never triggers except for like the one time that I decided to test it. Seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nThere are additional efficiency concerns I also won&#39;t get into which relates to trying not to re-validate a field if it has the same value it was validated with last time. This is a whole other can of worms, but basically what it boils down to is that you should be able to not only validate a state before render, but you should have access to the previous state as well, so you can save some cpu time and only validate the fields that changed. For example, if you have a very long textarea with some complex regex, it would be nice to not validate that on every component render even if its a separate field that is changing.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nI&#39;m very thoroughly disappointed that react seems to provide no legitimate option for this. Seeing as you can call setState many times in one operation, and each one will be queued, how is it that they don&#39;t provide us with one callback after all state changes are resolved and we&#39;re about to render? Well if you think about it, the render function itself is this callback, because I think its only ever called after setStates are resolved, but again, its evil to call setState on render, and it would be a million times cleaner to have render() simply receive the correct state, so I don&#39;t see how this is very useful.\n\nDoes anyone know why they decided to get rid of componentWillUpdate?\n",

Why risk that kind of isolation and &quot;rebuild&quot; a parser in your Node.js script? If your Node.js script breaks, your whole script will fail. In the worst case, you might even expose your machine to serious risks when you try to run untrusted code inside your main thread.\n\nInstead, try to do as much parsing as possible inside the context of the page. You can even do an evil  call there. There worst that could happen? Your browser hangs or crashes.\n\nExample\n\nImagine the following HTML page (very much simplified). You are trying to read the text which is pushed into an array. The only information you have is that there is an additional attribute  which is set to .\n\n\n\nBad code\n\nHere is a simple example what your code might look like right now:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the script extracts the JavaScript code from the page. Now we have the JavaScript code from the page and we &quot;only&quot; need to parse it, right? Well, this is the wrong approach. Don&#39;t try to rebuild a parser inside Node.js. Just use the browser. There are basically two approaches you can take to do that in your case.\n\n\nInject proxy functions into the page and fake some built-in functions (recommended)\nParse the data on the client-side (!) by using , a regex or  (eval only if really necessary)\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Inject proxy functions into the page\n\nIn this approach you are replacing native browser functions with your own &quot;fake functions&quot;. Example:\n\n\n\nThis code replaces the original  function with our own function. Everything works as normal, but when an item with our target id is pushed into an array, a special condition is triggered. To inject this function into the page, you could use . To receive the data from Node.js you would have to expose a function to the browser via :\n\n\n\nNow it doesn&#39;t really matter how complex the code of the page is, whether it happens inside some asynchronous handler or whether the page changes the surrounding code. As long as the target data is pushing the data into an array, we will get it.\n\nYou can use this approach for a lot of crawling. Check how the data is processed and replace the low level functions processing the data with your own proxy version of it.\n\nOption 2: Parse the data\n\nLet&#39;s assume the first approach does not work for some reason. The data is in some script tag, but you are not able to get it by using fake functions.\n\nThen you should parse the data, but not inside your Node.js environment. Do it inside the page context. You could run a regular expression or use . But do it before returning the data back to Node.js. This approach has the benefit that if your code will crash your environment for some reason, it will not be your main script, but just your browser that crashes.\n\nTo give some example code. Instead of running the code from the original &quot;bad code&quot; sample, we change it to this:\n\n\n\nThis will only return the parts of the code we need, which can then be fruther processed from within Node.js.\n\n\n\nIndependent of which approach you choose, both ways are much better and more secure than running unknown code inside your main thread. If you absolutely have to process the data in your Node.js environment, use a regular expression for it like shown in the answer from trincot. You should never use eval to run untrusted code.\n",

The official &quot;If is Evil&quot; page shows essentially the following as a good way to do things:\n\n\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to these various approaches.  One big advantage to a regex is that you can capture parts of the match and use them to modify the response.  Of course, you can usually achieve similar results with the other approaches by either setting a variable in the original block or using .  The downside of the regex approach is that it can get unwieldy if you want to match a variety of locations, plus the low precedence of a regex might just not fit with how you want to match locations —&#160;not to mention that  there are apparently performance impacts from regexes in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of including files (as far as I can tell) is that it is a little more flexible about exactly what you can include —&#160;it doesn&#39;t have to be a full location block, for example.  But it&#39;s also just subjectively a bit clunkier than named locations.\n\nAlso note that there is a related solution that you may be able to use in similar situations: nested locations.  The idea is that you would start with a very general location, apply some configuration common to several of the possible matches, and then have separate nested locations for the different types of paths that you want to match.

This runs in linear time, making complex patterns faster. It is located in the regexp package.\n\n\nRead more about the differences between backtracking and non-backtracking engines here.\n\n\n\nConsidering the glob library (according to that GitHub link) appears faster than Go&#39;s regexps, performance shouldn&#39;t be a problem.\n",

Basically, catastrophic backtracking happens when a regex fails to match and different permutations of the same regex can find a partial match.  The regex engine then tries all those permutations.  If you want to go over your code and inspect your regexes these are the 3 key issues to look at:\n\n\nAlternatives must be mutually exclusive.  If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails.  If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.  A classic example is  to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a &quot;dot matches line breaks&quot; mode.  If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces (matched by both  and ) will break the regex.  The fix is to use  to make the alternatives mutually exclusive or even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as  for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.\nQuantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive what comes between them.  Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match.  A classic example is  to match 3 things with &quot;anything&quot; between them. When  can&#39;t be matched the first  will expand character by character until the end of the line or file.  For each expansion the second  will expand character by character to match the remainder of the line or file.  The fix is to realize that you can&#39;t have &quot;anything&quot; between them.  The first run needs to stop at  and the second run needs to stop at .  With single characters  is an easy solution.  Since we now stop at the delimiter, we can use possessive quantifiers to further increase performance.\nA group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it.  That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.  This is the problem illustrated in JDB&#39;s answer.\n\n\nWhile I was writing my answer I decided that this merited a full article on my website.  This is now online too.\n",

They have a sweet point (mainly simple assignment or builtin operations). But if the actor is any kind of non-trivial you&#39;ll see the complexity ramp up quickly, not just for the human but also for the compiler. This leads to\n\n\nslow compilation\nsub-optimal emitted code\nharder to maintain source\nnew classes of error (e.g. when the expression templates hold references to locals/temporaries, something that Boost Proto (and hence Phoenix) does not prevent or signal. In fact, it encourages it by assuming all template expressions are ephemeral, but I digress).\n\n\n\n  Interestingly: Spirit X3 dropped Phoenix altogether, even though Phoenix was once the brain child of Spirit&#179;.\n  \n  The new style uses c++14 polymorphic lambdas, that look 90% like the helper function object in the original code, but inline as a lambda.\n\n\nThis specific case\n\nCan&#39;t work. At all.\n\nThe problem is that you&#39;re mixing lazy/deferred actors with direct invocations. That can never work. The type of  isn&#39;t supposed to be . Of course. It is supposed to be a lazy actor&#185; that can be used at some later time to create a . \n\nNow that we know that (and why)  is an actor type, it should become clear why it is completely bogus to call  on it. You might as well say\n\n\n\nAnd wonder why it would not compile.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should probably just have the dedicated functor. You can of course Phoenix-adapt the regex functions you require, but all it does is shift the complexity tax for some syntactic sugar.\n\nI&#39;d always opt for the more naive approach that is going to be more understandable to a seasoned c++ programmer, and avoids pitfalls that come with high-wire acts&#178;.\n\nNevertheless, here&#39;s a pointer should you be curious:\n\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/phoenix/modules/function.html\n\nLive On Coliru\n\n\n\n\n\n&#185; think composed function object that can be invoked at a later time\n\n&#178; the balance might tip if you were designing this as an EDSL for further configuration by non-experts, but then you will have the added responsibility of documenting your EDSL and the constraints in which it can be used\n\n&#179; should we say, spirit-child of a brain?\n",

            "body": "The worst input for a regular expression will vary from engine to engine. The same regex and string may take no time at all on one engine, but never finish on another.\n\nDifferences between engines\n\nEngine Type\n\nFor certain engines, the &quot;evilest&quot; regex is still benign, running in linear time (or  time when both the length of the regex and the length of the string may vary.) Of course, the reason for this is the implementation. These engines don&#39;t backtrack; instead they use a finite state machine (FSM).\n\nNote that some backtracking implementations use FSM, but only as an intermediate step. Don&#39;t let this confuse you; they&#39;re not FSM.\n\nMost of the old regex engines (like sed) use FSM matching. There are a few new engines that use this implementation, such as Go. PCRE even has DFA functions (search for &quot;DFA&quot; here) that use this type of matching.\n\nAnother answer of mine also addresses the potential speed difference between the two implementations.\n\nIt would be wise to consider using a FSM implementation if you are really worried about malicious input affecting the speed of your regex. Unfortunately, FSM is not as powerful as the other implementation; it lacks support for some features, such as back references.\n\nOptimizations\n\nEvil is actually a bit subjective. Something evil to one regex engine may not be evil to a different engine. An evil plot can be thwarted if the engine is optimized. Optimizations are particularly important to backtracking engines, given their potential exponential run time.\n\nShort-circuiting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the engine may be able to quickly determine a match is impossible. While running the regex  against the string , Regex101 says:\n\n\n  Your match failed outright. What this means is the engine, due to its internal optimizations, understood that your pattern would never match at any position, and thus did not even attempt to.\n\n\nKeep in mind that Wikipedia says the regex is evil, especially when paired with that string.\n\nOf course, the engine is smart to not need to backtrack to determine the match wouldn&#39;t work. It saw something pretty obvious: the regex needs an  in order to match, but no  was present in the string.\n\nModifiers\n\nI mention this because you might not expect modifiers to be a factor in regex performance. But they are.\n\nEven PCRE, one of the more optimized implementations, may take considerably more steps with both the  and  modifiers enabled. See my question here for more information about this. In the end, I figured out that only certain characters trigger this behavior.\n\nAnalyzing Strings\n\nString length\n\nIn general, a long string will be slower than a short string. In fact, if you find a string of length x that causes catastrophic backtracking, you can make it backtrack a bit more by increasing the length of the string.\n\nGreedy vs. Lazy\n\nCompare the speeds of these regexes:\n\n\n  on \n on \n  on \n on \n\n\nEssentially, greedy matching is best when you think you will need to match a lot. Lazy matching is best when you need to match only a little.\n\nNote that if you change the regex to  or , then the engine may optimize things considerably.\n\nBrute force testing\n\nThere are several frameworks that are specifically designed to try to find vulnerabilities in your regexes. It may be worthwhile to try one out.\n\nThere&#39;s really one thing that I will suggest if you wanted to try making your own algorithm. It&#39;s not practical to try all characters in the dictionary, especially if you want to test long strings.\n\nInstead, look at your regex to determine what characters you should test. If you have  as your regex, there are really only two things that go into the match:  and not . You could really just imagine that there are only two characters:  and  (aka not ) when you generate your strings to brute force with.\n\nSetting timeouts\n\nIt would be fantastic to be able to ensure your regex finishes before the heat death of the universe, right? Some regex engines do have a way to set a time out.\n\n.NET:\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\n\n  \n  \n  Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it exists, the  value defined in the .\n  \n  When called,  restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script execution a call such as  is made, the script will run for a total of 45 seconds before timing out.\n\n\nPerl\n\nYou might as well visit the link, since it&#39;s right on Stack Overflow.\n",

            "body": "TL;DR\n\nIn short, &quot;backtracking&quot; is when a regex engine returns to a &quot;flexible&quot; match, attempting a different path to get a successful match.\n\nBacktracking with Alternation\n\nFor example, in the following pattern and input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regex engine will match &quot;foo&quot;, then attempt the first of the two options, matching &quot;b&quot; and then &quot;a&quot;, but fails at &quot;r&quot;. Rather than failing the whole match, though, it will &quot;rewind the tape&quot; and start with the second alternative, matching &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; and then &quot;z&quot;... success!\n\nBacktracking with Quantifiers\n\nThis also works with quantifiers. A quantifier is anything that encourages the engine to match a repeating pattern, including , ,  and  (depending on the engine).\n\nA greedy quantifier (the default) will match as many repetitions as possible before moving on to the rest of the pattern. For example, given the pattern and input below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern  will begin by matching the entire string: &quot;foobar&quot;. However, when it moves on to the , the regex engine has reach the end of the input and the match fails. Rather than simply giving up, the engine will ask the last greedy quantifier to give up one of its repetitions, now matching &quot;fooba&quot;. The match still fails, so the engine asks  to give up the &quot;a&quot; (failure), and then the &quot;b&quot;. After giving up the &quot;b&quot;, the engine can now match , and the match succeeds.\n\nTrees and Backtracking\n\nAnother way of thinking of a regex is as a &quot;tree&quot;, and backtracking is going back up a node and trying another path. Given the pattern  and the input &quot;foobaz&quot;, the engine will attempt something like the following:\n\n\n\nCounting the &quot;Backtracks&quot;\n\nAs to why you see differences in the &quot;number&quot; of backtracks... this probably has a lot to do with internal optimizations and logging level. For example, RegexBuddy does not appear to be logging the match to the empty string before , while regex101 does. In the end, though, it doesn&#39;t really matter what exact order you backtrack in (what order you climb back up the tree) so long as you end up with the same result.\n\nEvil Regexes\n\nYou already know this, but for the benefit of anyone else who happens by, your regex was written to demonstrate &quot;catastrophic backtracking&quot; (aka &quot;evil regex&quot;), where the number of backtrack attempts grows exponentially as the length of the input increases. These regexes can be exploited to perform DoS attacks, so you must use caution not to introduce these into your patterns (as I found out).\n",

Regexes can however &quot;extract&quot; data. Extracting is what they&#39;re made for. The major drawback of regex HTML extraction over proper SGML toolkits or baseline XML parsers are their syntactic effort and varying reliability.\n\nConsider that making a somewhat dependable HTML extraction regex:\n\n\n\nis way less readable than a simple phpQuery or QueryPath equivalent:\n\n\n\nThere are however specific use cases where they can help.\n\n\nMany DOM traversal frontends don&#39;t reveal HTML comments , which however are sometimes the more useful anchors for extraction. In particular pseudo-HTML variations  or SGML residues are easy to tame with regexps.\nOftentimes regular expressions can save post-processing. However HTML entities often require manual caretaking.\nAnd lastly, for extremely simple tasks like extracting &lt;img src= urls, they are in fact a probable tool. The speed advantage over SGML/XML parsers mostly just comes to play for these very basic extraction procedures.\n\n\nIt&#39;s sometimes even advisable to pre-extract a snippet of HTML using regular expressions  and process the remainder using the simpler HTML parser frontends.\n\nNote: I actually have this app, where I employ XML parsing and regular expressions alternatively. Just last week the PyQuery parsing broke, and the regex still worked. Yes weird, and I can&#39;t explain it myself. But so it happened.\nSo please don&#39;t vote real-world considerations down, just because it doesn&#39;t match the regex=evil meme. But let&#39;s also not vote this up too much.

            "body": "How regex alternation is implemented in Perl is fairly well explained in \n\n\n  Matching this or that\n  \n  We can match different character strings with the alternation\n  metacharacter  . To match  or  , we form the regex  .\n  As before, Perl will try to match the regex at the earliest possible\n  point in the string. At each character position, Perl will first try\n  to match the first alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match, Perl will\n  then try the next alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match either, then\n  the match fails and Perl moves to the next position in the string.\n  Some examples:\n\n\n  \n  Even though  is the first alternative in the second regex,  is able to match\n  earlier in the string.\n\n\n  \n  Here, all the alternatives match at the first string position, so the\n  first alternative is the one that matches. If some of the alternatives\n  are truncations of the others, put the longest ones first to give them\n  a chance to match.\n\n\n  \n  The last example points out \n  that character classes are like alternations of characters. At a given\n  character position, the first alternative that allows the regexp match\n  to succeed will be the one that matches.\n\n\nSo this should explain the price you pay when using alternations in regex.\n\nWhen putting simple regex together, you don&#39;t pay such a price. It&#39;s well explained in another related question in SO. When directly searching for a constant string, or a set of characters as in the question, optimizations can be done and no backtracking is needed which means potentially faster code.\n\nWhen defining the regex alternations, just choosing a good order (putting the most common findings first) can influence the performance. It is not the same either to choose between two options, or twenty. As always, premature optimization is the root of all evil and you should instrumentiate you code (Devel::NYTProf) if there are problems or you want improvements. But as a general rule alternations should be kept to a minimum and avoided if possible since:\n\n\nThey easily make the regex too big an complex. We like simple, easy to understand / debug / maintain regex.\nVariability and input dependant. They could be an unexpected source of problems since they backtrack and can lead to unexpected lack of performance depending on your input. As I understand, there&#39;s no case when they will be faster.\nConceptually you are trying to match two different things, so we could argue that two different statements are more correct and clear than just one.\n\n\nHope this answer gets closer to what you were expecting.\n",

Then again, although this works well if you want the user to choose the files they&#39;re uploading, it might not be the best solution if you want to implement some kind of HTML5 drag&#39;n&#39;drop solution, etc. \n\nCoincidentally, I spent pretty much all of last week studying how to upload files via javascript to ASP.NET web forms. I developed a drag and drop interface that uses HTML5, and also developed a fail-over method with which the user could choose and upload their files via the  control.\n\nDue to the feature being low-priority, we only fully developed the  control, but I&#39;m happy to share that feature with you here:\n\nHTML\n\nWe&#39;re going to create an ASP file upload control, and hide certain parts of it.

By script related attributes I mean any attribute that starts with on. \n\n\n\nMy first thought was to use BeautifulSoup to remove the tags and attributes. Unfortunately, I am unable to use BeautifulSoup. Seeing that BeautifulSoup is off the table I can see two options for doing this. The first option I see is splitting the strings and parsing based on index. This seems like a bad solution to me.\n\nThe other option is to use Regular Expressions. However, we know that isn&#39;t a good solution either (Cthulhu Parsing).\n\nNow with that in mind, I personally feel it is alright to use regular expressions to strip the attributes. After all, with those it is still simple string manipulation. \n\nSo for removing the attributes I have:\n\n\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I personally think the above perfectly acceptable use of Regular Expression with HTML. But still I would like to get some opinions on the above usage. \n\nThen there is the question of the script tags. I&#39;m very tempted to go with Regular Expressions for this because I know them and I know what I need is pretty simple. Something like:\n\n\n\nThe above would start to get me close to what I need. And yes I realize the above RegEx will grab everything starting at the first opening script tag until the last closing script tag, but it&#39;s a starting example. \n\nI&#39;m very tempted to use Regular Expressions as I&#39;m familiar with them (more so than Python) and I know that is the quickest way to achieve the results I want, at least for me it is. \n\nSo I need help to go against my nature and not be evil. I want to be evil and use RegEx so somebody please show me the light and guide me to the promised land on non-Regular Expressions.\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt looks like I wasn&#39;t very clear about what my question actually is, I apologize for that. My question is how can I parse the HTML using pure Python without Regular Expressions? \n\n\n\nAs for the above code example, it&#39;s wrong. I know it is wrong, I was using it as an example of a starting point. \n\nI hope this clears up my question some\n\nUpdate 2\n\nI just wanted to add a few more notes about what I am  doing. \n\nI am crawling a web site to get the data I need.\n\nOnce we have the page that contains the data we need it is saved to the database.\n\nThen the saved web page is displayed to the user.\n\nThe issue I am trying to solve happens here. The application throws a script error when you attempt to interact with the page that forces the user to click on a confirmation box. The application is not a web browser but uses the web browser DLL in Windows (I cannot remember the name at the moment).\n\nThe error in question only happens in this one page for this one web site.\n\nUpdate 3\n\nAfter adding the update I realized I was over thinking the problem, I was looking for a more generic solution. However, in this case that isn&#39;t what is needed. \n\nThe page is dynamically generated, however the script tags will stay static. With that in mind the solution becomes much simpler. With that I no longer need to treat it like HTML but as static strings.\n\nSo the solution I&#39;m looking at is\n\n\n\nI would like to avoid Regular Expression however, since I&#39;m limited to only using the standard library regular expressions seems like the best solution in this case.

And there is never a good reason.\nin the worst case  makes your application vulnerable to injection attacks and also it&#39;s very slow. A bit of research reveals plenty of reasons why eval is a big no-no.\nDon&#39;t save your calculation code into the database\nIf you do so and you would like to switch from PHP to another language you would still have PHP code in your database. It makes it really hard to migrate languages. You should always strive to make as many parts of your application as independent as possible.\nIn this case you would tight-couple the language you use, to the database. That&#39;s a bad practice.\nAlso the only possibilities to run your calculations from the database would be to eval them (which is bad, see above) or to disassemble the string with string operations or regex which causes unnecessary effort.\nIt&#39;s all about Strategy\nIn order to solve your problem you must execute code dependent of which calculation you need. That could be either done with switch-case-statements or if-statements. But that&#39;s also not a very elegant solution. Imagine you would need to execute other operations before calculating in the future, or extend functionality. You would need to update all your cases or if-statements.\nThere is a nice design-pattern which is called Strategy Pattern. The strategy pattern solves problems when one use-case can be handled differently which is probably what you want.\nYou want to calculate something (use-case) and there are different calculation types for it (different strategies)\nHow it works\nTo implement the Strategy pattern you basically need three things.\n\nA class where you inject your strategies. It&#39;s basically a wrapper for your strategy tasks.\nAn interface which will be implemented by your strategies\nYour strategies\n\nYour interface could look like this:\n\nThe interface will make sure that all your strategies provide a method to actually run the calculation. Nothing special.\nNext you may want to have a base class that takes your calculation operators as constructor arguments and stores them into properties.\n\nNow it&#39;s getting serious. We are implementing our strategies.\n\nOf course you could clean this one up a bit, but what I want to point out here is the class declaration.\nWe are extending our  class so that we can pass the arithmetic operations via constructor and we are implementing the  which tells our class: &quot;Hey! You must provide a calculate method, I don&#39;t care whether you want or not.\nWe&#39;ll see later why this is an integral part of the pattern.\nSo we have two concrete classes that contain the actual code for the actual arithmetic operation. If you would ever need to, you could change it easily as you see.\nTo add more operations just add another class.\nNow we will create a class where our strategies can be injected. Later you will instantiate an object of this class and work with it.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\nThe most important part here is the constructor. See how we type-hint our interface here. By doing that we make sure that only an object can be injected (Dependency Injection) whose class implements the interface. We do not need to demand a concrete class here. That&#39;s the crucial point here.\nAlso there&#39;s a calculate method in there. It&#39;s just a wrapper for our strategy to execute it&#39;s calculate method.\nWrapping it up\nSo now we just need to create an object of our  class and pass an object of one of our strategy classes (that contain the code for the arithmetic operations).\n\nTry replacing the string stored in  to  and you see that the operation for calculating the percentage will be executed.\nConclusion\nThe strategy pattern allowed you to create a clean interface for working with dynamic tasks that are only made concrete during runtime. Neither your database needs to know how we calculate things, nor your actual calculator does. The only thing we need to make sure is to code against an interface that provides a method to let us calculate things.\n",

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nBy sending headers inadvertently, you might have introduced a security vulnerability: say, you are doing a redirection, but hence the headers are already sent, the redirection does not work and the rest of the page might be output, thus the visitor may see what she was not supposed to see. While this can be mitigated by using exit, you know the story, only if every one of us utilize good programming habits every time.\nEven if letting the visitor stay in the wrong page does not have a security implication, by breaking a session behavior, or in some other ways I&#39;ve encountered over years, the security and/or session cycle might have taken some sort of blow in the end.\nIf not security, you may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after ?&gt;. An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

That&#39;s not what you intended, but it is the way regexes work. (The &quot;longest left-most rule&quot;.) In theory, it&#39;s still possible to match the regex without killing the stack, but I doubt whether the regex library you&#39;re using is clever enough to make that optimization.\n\nYou can fix the regex to match what you want it to match by making the data part () non-greedy: change it to . That might also fix the stack blow-up problem, because it will cause the regex to match much earlier, before it blows up the stack. But I don&#39;t know if it will work in general; I really don&#39;t know anything about the MS implementation.\n\nIn my opinion, you should avoid back references, even though it means complicating your code a bit. What I would do is to first match:\n\n\n\nand then create the terminating string:\n\n\n\nand then  the terminating string. That means you can no longer use the regex library&#39;s iterator, which is unfortunate, but the loop is still pretty straight-forward.\n\nBy the way, I find it odd that you only recognize the start delimiter if it is at the end of a line, and the end delimiter if it is at the start of a line.

This is only feasible if you know in advance what kind of regexes you&#39;ll be getting.\n\nThe next best best method in the  class is  or . However, we need to parse the regex if we do this.\n\nI can&#39;t speak for the future, but as of Ruby 2.0, there is no better method in the  core class.\n\nA left parenthesis denotes a literal left parenthesis, if preceded by an unescaped backslash. A backslash is unescaped unless an unescaped backslash precedes. So, a character is escaped iff preceded by an odd number of backslashes. \n\nAn unescaped left parenthesis denotes a capturing group iff not followed by a question mark. With a question mark, it can mean various things:  and  denote a named capturing group. Named and unnamed capturing groups cannot coexist in the same regex, however[2].  denote non-capturing groups. This is a special case of .  denote atomic groups. , ,  and  denote lookaround.  denote comments.\n\nRuby regexp engine supports comments in regexes. Considering them in the main regex would be very difficult. We can try to strip them if we really want to support these, but supporting them fully will get messy due to the possibility of inline flags turning extended mode (and thus line comments) on and off in ways that a regular expression cannot capture. I will go ahead and not support unescaped parentheses in regex comments[3].\n\nWe want to count:\n\n\nthe number of left parentheses \nthat are not escaped by a backslash  (read: not preceded by an odd number of backslashes that are not preceded by yet another backslash) and \nthat are not followed by a question mark \n\n\nRuby doesn&#39;t support unbounded lookbehind, but if we reverse the source first, we can rewrite the first assertion slightly: . The second assertion becomes a lookbehind: . \n\nthe whole solution\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: we can show the NP-hardness by converting the satisfiability problem to it:\n\n\nAND:  ( must be an assertion)\nOR: \nNOT: \natoms: , , , ..., , ...\n\n\nexample(XOR): \n\nthis extends to NP-completeness for any class of regexes that can be tested in polynomial time. This includes any regex with no nested repetition (or repeated backreferences to repetition or recursion) and with bounded nesting depth of optional matches.\n\n[2]:  returns , indicating that unnamed capturing groups are ignored when named capturing groups are present. Tested in Ruby 1.9.3\n\n[3]: Inline comments start with  and end with . They cannot contain an unescaped right parenthesis, but they can contain an unescaped left parenthesis. These can be stripped easily (even though we have to sprinkle the &quot;unescaped&quot; regex everywhere), are the lesser evil, but they&#39;re also less likely to contain anunescaped left parenthesis.\n\nLine comments start with  and end with a newline. These are only treated as comments in the extended mode. Outside the extended mode, they match the literal  and newline. This is still easy, even if we have to consider escaping again. Determining if the regex has the extended flag set is not too difficult, but the flag modifier groups are a different beast entirely.\n\nEven with Ruby&#39;s awesome recursive regexes, merely determining if a previously-open group modifying the extended mode is already closed would yield a very nasty regex (even if you replace one by one and don&#39;t have to skip comments, you have to account for escaping).

Anyway here is what I got..\n\n\n\nAre there ANY regexp guru&#39;s out there that could give me some pointers or a regexp that mimics what I need? Which is only getting the deepest stacked instance of a {{tag}} that ends like this {{//tag}}\n\nORIGINAL\n\nOk, so I have an issue I have seen others have, but with a different approach to it.. Or so I thought.. So I am curious if anyone else can help me solve this issue further..\n\nI have a database full of templates that I need to work with in PHP, these templates are made and used by another system, and so there for can not be changed. With that said, these templates have hierarchy style tags added to them. What I need to do, is get these templates from the database, and then programmatically find these tags, their function name (or tag name), and their inner contents, as well as anything following the function (tag) name within the brackets.. An example of one of these tags is, {{FunctionName some (otherStuff) !Here}} Some content sits inside and it ends {{/FunctionName}}\n\nThis is where it gets more fun, the templates have another random tag, which I am guessing are the &quot;variable&quot; style of these tags, as they are always generally the same syntax. Which looks like this, ${RandomTag}, but also there are times that the function style one is there but without an ending tag, like so.. {{RandomLoner}}\n\nExample Template...\n\n\n\nOk so in no way is this a real template, but it follows all the rules that I have seen thus far.\n\nNow I have tried different things with regex and preg_match_all to pull out the matches, and get each of these into a nice array. So far what I have got is this (used it on the example template to make sure its working still)\n\n\n\nI have tried a couple approaches, (that took me nearly 8 hours to get to)\n\n\n\nIn no way am I a guru with regexp, I actually just learned it over the last day or so, trying to get this to work. I have googled for this, and realize that regexp is not designed for nested stuff, but the (?R) seems to do the trick on simple bracket examples Ive seen on the internets, but they always only take into account of the stuff between the { and } or ( and ) or &lt; and &gt;. After reading nearly the whole regex info website, and playing, I came up with these 2 versions.\n\nSo what I NEED to do (I think), would have a regexp work from the DEEPEST hierarchy tag first, and work its way out (if I can do that with help from php, thats fine with me). I was thinking finding the Deepest layer, get its data, and work backwards til all the contents are in 1 fat array. I assumed that was what the ($R) was going to do for me, but it didn&#39;t.\n\nSo any help on what I am missing would be great, also take into note that mine seems to have issues with {{}} that DONT have an ending version of it. So like my {{Random}} example, was removed for the sake of me parsing the array example. I feel these tags, along with the ${} tags can be left alone (if I knew how to do that with regexp), and just remain in the text where they are. I am more or less interested in the functions and getting their data into a multidimensional array for me to work with further.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just have been banging me head all night with this. I started with the assumption that it was going to be a bit easier.. Til I realized the tags where nested :/\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thanks!\n",

            "body": "For what it is worth, most scripting languages (like Perl) and non-static compile-time languages (like Pick) support automatic run-time dynamic String to (relatively arbitrary) object conversions. This CAN be accomplished in Java as well without losing type-safety and the good stuff statically-typed languages provide WITHOUT the nasty side-effects of some of the other languages that do evil things with dynamic casting. A Perl example that does some questionable math:\n\n\n\nIn Java, this is better accomplished (IMHO) by using a method I call &quot;cross-casting&quot;.\nWith cross-casting, reflection is used in a lazy-loaded cache of constructors and methods that are dynamically discovered via the following static method: \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, no built-in Java methods such as Class.cast() will do this for String to BigDecimal or String to Integer or any other conversion where there is no supporting class hierarchy. For my part, the point is to provide a fully dynamic way to achieve this - for which I don&#39;t think the prior reference is the right approach - having to code every conversion. Simply put, the implementation is just to cast-from-string if it is legal/possible.\n\nSo the solution is simple reflection looking for public Members of either:\n\nSTRING_CLASS_ARRAY = (new Class[] {String.class});\n\na) Member member = targetClass.getMethod(method.getName(),STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\nb) Member member = targetClass.getConstructor(STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\n\nYou will find that all of the primitives (Integer, Long, etc) and all of the basics (BigInteger, BigDecimal, etc) and even java.regex.Pattern are all covered via this approach. I have used this with significant success on production projects where there are a huge amount of arbitrary String value inputs where some more strict checking was needed. In this approach, if there is no method or when the method is invoked an exception is thrown (because it is an illegal value such as a non-numeric input to a BigDecimal or illegal RegEx for a Pattern), that provides the checking specific to the target class inherent logic.\n\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\n1) You need to understand reflection well (this is a little complicated and not for novices).\n2) Some of the Java classes and indeed 3rd-party libraries are (surprise) not coded properly. That is, there are methods that take a single string argument as input and return an instance of the target class but it isn&#39;t what you think... Consider the Integer class:\n\n\n\nThe above method really has nothing to do with Integers as objects wrapping primitives ints.\nReflection will find this as a possible candidate for creating an Integer from a String incorrectly versus the decode, valueof and constructor Members - which are all suitable for most arbitrary String conversions where you really don&#39;t have control over your input data but just want to know if it is possible an Integer.\n\nTo remedy the above, looking for methods that throw Exceptions is a good start because invalid input values that create instances of such objects should throw an Exception. Unfortunately, implementations vary as to whether the Exceptions are declared as checked or not. Integer.valueOf(String) throws a checked NumberFormatException for example, but Pattern.compile() exceptions are not found during reflection lookups. Again, not a failing of this dynamic &quot;cross-casting&quot; approach I think so much as a very non-standard implementation for exception declarations in object creation methods.\n\nIf anyone would like more details on how the above was implemented, let me know but I think this solution is much more flexible/extensible and with less code without losing the good parts of type-safety. Of course it is always best to &quot;know thy data&quot; but as many of us find, we are sometimes only recipients of unmanaged content and have to do the best we can to use it properly.\n\nCheers.\n",

I also realized there&#39;d still be problems with other legitimate matches, such as EVIL: .\n\nSo what it appears I really need is the negation of preceding html entities missing a semicolon:\n\n\n\nBut it is still matching and I&#39;m not sure why.\n\nIt would be ideal to still get returned matches that can be replaced wholesale without further inspection, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.  What is not suitable is first parsing out the html entities, because sometimes they&#39;re necessary and/or part of a legitimate smiley (as with EVIL).\n\n\n\nEDIT (some Google food):\n\nI discovered (and Bryan also noted below) that Zero-width positive lookbehind, , would work as desired (not Zero-width negative lookahead ).\n\nAs per regular-expressions.info, the latter &quot;will only succeed if the regex inside the lookahead fails to match&quot; which sounds right, but isn&#39;t when the section is optional anyway.\n\nIn contrast, the former &quot;matches at a position if the pattern inside the lookahead can be matched ending at that position&quot; which isn&#39;t at all clear, but does the trick.

A more complicated version of this would consider plurals and past tenses of the word as well.\nWrite an array of suspicious words, and score each one.

We Python users have trancended mere text manipulation!&quot; but no one is explaining why you&#39;re experiencing this problem.\n\nYour regex is working. It takes any alphabet, whitespace, or hyphen character and turns it into the number . The problem is that it thinks the negative sign in  is &quot;evil text&quot; to turn into a number.\n\nOne way to approach this is to provide an anchor for your regex - Make it match the commas (or beginning/ending of the string) surrounding the text. So it would see  and turn it into  but would see  and know that it&#39;s not text.\n\nAnother approach is to filter based on &quot;does it not contain digits&quot; instead of &quot;does it contain these things I need&quot; - because what if, later, you need to filter out other punctuation marks? Using  would match &quot;things that aren&#39;t digits or commas&quot;, which would turn  into  but keep  the same.\n\nA third approach is to split the string on commas, then test and change each individual segment - probably to see if it contains digits - and then join them back together.\n\nIf you choose the first or second approaches, I leave it up to you to write a regex that either matches a leading comma or the beginning of a string (and a trailing comma or the end of the string - both are similar).

If you&#39;re trying to validate input in ASP.NET, I would definitely use a RegularExpressionValidator for this particular pattern, because otherwise you&#39;ll have to waste your time writing a CustomValidator for a pretty meager performance boost. See my answer to this other question for a little guidance on when and when not to use regex. \n\nIn this case, the reason I&#39;d use a regex validator has less to do with the pattern itself and more to do with ASP.NET. A RegularExpressionValidator can just be dragged and dropped into your ASPX code, and all you&#39;d have to write would be 10-21 characters of regex. With a CustomValidator, you&#39;d have to write custom validation functions, both in the codebehind and the JavaScript. You might squeeze a little more performance out of it, but think about when validation comes into play: only once per postback. The performance difference is going to be less than a millisecond.

            "body": "Overview\n\nAround the end of 2009, I wrote a simple templating system for PHP/HTML to be used in-house by our designers for brochure-ware type websites. The goal of the system is to allow templating in otherwise pure HTML via custom tags that are processed by PHP. For example, a templated page might look like this:\n\n\n\nThe template itself might look something like this:\n\n\n\nBesides the Page and Content/Container tags, there are a few other tags included in the core for stuff like flow control, iterating over a collection, outputting dynamic values, etc. The framework is designed so it&#39;s very easy to add your own set of tags registered under another prefix and namespace.\n\nCustom Tags to PHP\n\nHow do we parse these custom tags? Since the&#39;re no guarantee that the HTML file is well-formed XML, solutions like XSLT/XPATH won&#39;t be reliable. Instead, we use a regex to look for tags with registered prefixes, and replace those with PHP code. The PHP code is a stack-based design... upon encountering an opening tag, an object representing the tag is created pushed onto the stack, and its &quot;initialization function&quot; (if any) runs. Whenever a registered closing tag is encountered, the most recent object is popped off the stack, and its &quot;rendering function&quot; runs.\n\nSo, after the framework replaces the templating tags with PHP, our example page might look something like this (in realty it&#39;s a bit uglier):\n\n\n\nThe good, the bad, and \n\nNow, how to execute our newly-generated PHP code? I can think of a few options here. The easiest is to simply  the string, and that works well enough. However, any programmer will tell you &quot;eval is evil, don&#39;t use it...&quot; so the question is, is there anything more appropriate than  that we can use here? \n\nI&#39;ve considered using a temporary or cached file, using  output streams, etc, but as far as I can see these don&#39;t offer any real advantage over . Caching could speed things up, but in practice all the sites we have on this thing are already blazingly fast, so I see no need to make speed optimizations at this point.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor each of the things on this list: is it a good idea? Can you think of a better alternative?\n\n\nthe whole idea in general (custom tags for html / php)\nconverting tags to php code instead of processing directly\nthe stack-based approach \nthe use of  (or similar)\n\n\nThanks for reading and TIA for any advice. :)\n",

This lets you iterate over each individual character, which more clearly indicates your intent, is less prone to bugs as you know you&#39;re treating each character at once, and is more efficient*.  Likewise your valid character sets should also be characters.\n\nYour logic is pretty strangely expressed; you&#39;re not even referencing the specialChars set at all, and the looping logic once you&#39;ve found a match seems odd.  I think this is your bug; the matching seems to be the wrong way round in that if the character matches the first valid char, you set flag to  and continue round the current loop; so it will definitely not match the next valid char and hence you break out of the loop with a  flag.  Always.\n\nI would have thought something like this would be more intuitive:\n\n\n\nThis doesn&#39;t take sequences into account (e.g. the strings &quot;--------**  &quot; and &quot;1&quot; would be valid because all individual characters are valid) but then neither does your original code.

If that doesn&#39;t,\nREMOVE THE BINARY because the program is badly behaved.\nAs a general principle we don&#39;t use Unix Railgun to trim the hedges.  https://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#kill\nExplanation of above command:\n produces a list of process id&#39;s on the computer visible to this user.  The pipe grep filters that down for rows containing that string.  The  says don&#39;t match on the process itself doing the grepping.  The pipe awk print says split the rows on default delimiter whitespace and filter to the second column which is our process id.  The pipe xargs spins up a new process to send all those pid&#39;s to , ending them all.\nWhy  is bad, dangerous, ugly and hackish:\n\nThere&#39;s a small possibility that you will accidentally end the operating system or cause undefined behavior in an unrelated process, leading to whole system instability because  lists thousands of processes, and you can&#39;t be sure some 3rd party process shares your process name, or that in the time between read and execute kill -9, the processid had changed to something else, and now you&#39;ve ended some random necessary process unrelated to yours.\n\nIf the code being force-ended is doing any database ops or secure transactions with low probability race conditions, some fraction of a percent of the time, atomicity of that transaction will be wrecked, producing undefined behavior.  kill -9 takes no prisoners.  If your code is sensitive to this, try replacing the  part with a transmitted flag that requests a graceful shutdown, and only if that request is denied, last-resort to \n\n\nBut, if you understand all the risks and control for them with unique names, and you&#39;re ok with a few dropped transactions or occasional corruption, then 99.9% of the time yer gonna be fine. If there&#39;s a problem, reboot the computer, make sure there aren&#39;t any process collisions.

            "body": "I know how terribly wrong it is to (attempt to) parse HTML with Regex, which is why I&#39;m trying really, really hard to avoid it.\n\nI have an app that generates HTML emails. We&#39;re using a big fancy WYSIWYG drop in email editor that takes care of generating responsive emails and also generates the abysmal markup for clients like MS Outlook. It does that last bit using conditional comments, which look something like the following. Note that the  has an  attribute, and wraps the  tag that non-mso clients will see.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one of dozens (possibly hundreds?) of possible formattings that we need to work with.\n\nPrior to the introduction of this editor, we asked our customers to generate their own HTML emails with a more rudimentary WYSIWYG HMTL editor; but it was incumbent on them to make responsive templates and test their content in various clients. From their perspective, this new editor is a huge win.\n\nAs we&#39;re sending emails, it&#39;s important to track the link clicks via a tracking link that redirects through to the originally-intended link.\n\nTo date, we&#39;ve used jSoup to parse the email content, looking for any anchor tags and replace their href attribute contents. Because regex html parsing is evil, right?\n\nConditional comments have thrown a wrench in those gears.\n\nBecause they are comments, jSoup ignores them, and clicks from MS Outlook and other clients that handle the  markup haven&#39;t been transformed to go through our link tracker, so the clicks don&#39;t get tracked. This is a problem for us.\n\n\n\nFirst idea: replace the conditional comments with a custom tag\n\nAt first I was hopeful to pre-process the message body before letting jSoup have it. I would replace  with  and  with . This was simple enough to do, even for complex forms of the conditions inside the comments. I used a regex to make some simple replacements:\n\n\n became \n became  \netc\n\n\nNotice that I url-encoded the original comment in its entirety. url-encoding it made sure that I could easily use regex to find my marker comments and transform them back (so that I didn&#39;t have to worry about  inside the &quot;orig&quot; attribute content...\n\nThis started to break down when I realized there were multiple possible ways the comments could be closed. I spent a little bit of time working on a similar approach for the closing tags.\n\n\n became \nsame approach for  and \n\n\nI don&#39;t know if you can have attributes on a closing tag. I never tested it because I had another realization before I got to that point. The realization was that using  wasn&#39;t going to produce desirable output from jSoup because the resulting INPUT would often look like:\n\n\n\nThis is not tidy HTML and jSoup will try to correct it, changing the order of tags to make something that it thinks is more correct. When I realized that, I stopped what I was doing and started thinking about the problem again.\n\n\n\nSecond idea: the same thing, but with comments\n\nIf the (new) problem was that jSoup didn&#39;t like my tag nesting, what if I could expose the HTML from inside the conditional comments as if it weren&#39;t commented out, but keep some markers in as comments that I can later transform back into comments? The goal was to aim at making this:\n\n\n\nThis should parse as fairly tidy HTML, right? So I made the code modifications and gave it a shot.\n\nSadly, the documents that we&#39;re working with are far more complex than the simple example I started from above. Here&#39;s the first few lines of an actual sample document:\n\n\n\nAfter the comment conversion, we&#39;ve effectively dropped an  block into the  block, of which jSoup is decidedly not a fan. This is what I get back for the above input, after converting the conditional comments into my plain marked comments, parsing with jSoup, and then converting my markers back to their conditional comments:\n\n\n\nThere are some big problems here. The  block gets basically immediately closed. The  tag moves up to before the  block, and everything that came after it moved down into the body. This isn&#39;t going to work.\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\nI feel like we&#39;re basically out of options. \n\n\nDo nothing and just don&#39;t count the clicks from MS Outlook/etc clients. In some cases we might be able to detect a click anyway via a downstream conversion on that email. (Even if we don&#39;t have record of you clicking the link, if you made a payment then we know you got there...)\nWe could let our mail provider do the link tracking for us (experimentation required; not positive they would track the  links either). Historically we started this system with a provider that didn&#39;t offer link tracking so we had to roll our own. Current provider offers it, but we&#39;ve got years of existing code and processes that would have to be updated to support this change. We&#39;re keeping it in our back pocket if we can&#39;t figure something else out, but the prospect of changing ships mid-stream is ... not appealing.\nOr lastly... maybe... regex? (/me ducks) We could let jSoup do its thing for the normal HTML, and then use regex to replace any links that remain. This becomes a game of whack-a-mole with current and future markup. What might we run into aside from a  in the future? &#175;\\_(ツ)_/&#175; And we won&#39;t know what we&#39;re missing without regular manual reviews.\n\n\nUnless there&#39;s another option that we haven&#39;t explored yet. So... are we stuck with nothing/regex?\n\nWe&#39;re on the JVM so anything Java is within reach, I guess.\n",

After all perl itself goes out of it&#39;s way to violate the structure of its language and give you easy loops if you ask for them on the command line, I simply want to extend that idea for my operational/business domain. I even want to apply source filters (gasp!) if it helps. \n\nBut this question also suggests that I might want to be a good citizen of Perl as well, because I only to break the community guidelines in certain cases. It is quite awesome to be able to create major business-level actions just by changing the command line in a batch scheduler rather than writing a whole new module. The test cycle is much compressed. \n",

            "body": "The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Solution for Removing &quot;.html&quot; in NGINX:\nUPDATED ANSWER: This question piqued my curiosity, and I went on another, more in-depth search for a &quot;holy grail&quot; solution for  redirects in NGINX. Here is the link to the answer I found, since I didn&#39;t come up with it myself: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32966347/4175718\nHowever, I&#39;ll give an example and explain how it works. Here is the code:\n\nWhat&#39;s happening here is a pretty ingenious use of the  directive. NGINX runs a regex on the  portion of incoming requests. The regex checks if the URI has an .html extension and then stores the extension-less portion of the URI in the built-in variable .\nFrom the docs, since it took me a while to figure out where the  came from:\n\nRegular expressions can contain captures that are made available for later reuse in the $1..$9 variables.\n\nThe regex both checks for the existence of unwanted .html requests and effectively sanitizes the URI so that it does not include the extension. Then, using a simple  statement, the request is redirected to the sanitized URI that is now stored in .\nThe best part about this, as original author cnst explains, is that\n\nDue to the fact that $request_uri is always constant per request, and is not affected by other rewrites, it won&#39;t, in fact, form any infinite loops.\n\nUnlike the rewrites, which operate on any  request (including the invisible internal redirect to ), this solution only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.\nWhat does &quot;try_files&quot; do?\nYou will still need the  directive, as otherwise NGINX will have no idea what to do with the newly sanitized extension-less URIs. The  directive shown above will first try the new URL by itself, then try it with the &quot;.html&quot; extension, then try it as a directory name.\nThe NGINX docs also explain how the default  directive works. The default  directive is ordered differently than the example above so the explanation below does not perfectly line up:\n\nNGINX will first append  to the end of the URI and try to serve it. If it finds an appropriate  file, it will return that file and will maintain the extension-less URI. If it cannot find an appropriate  file, it will try the URI without any extension, then the URI as a directory, and then finally return a 404 error.\n\nUPDATE: What does the regex do?\nThe above answer touches on the use of regular expressions, but here is a more specific explanation for those who are still curious. The following regular expression (regex) is used:\n\nThis breaks down as:\n: indicates beginning of line.\n: match the character &quot;/&quot; literally. Forward slashes do NOT need to be escaped in NGINX.\n: capturing group: match any character an unlimited number of times\n: match the character &quot;.&quot; literally. This must be escaped with a backslash.\n: match the string &quot;html&quot; literally.\n: match a literal &quot;?&quot; or the end of the string. This is done to avoid mishandling file names with something after &quot;.html&quot;.\nThe capturing group  is what contains the non-&quot;.html&quot; portion of the URL. This can later be referenced with the variable . NGINX is then configured to re-try the request () and the  directive internally re-appends the &quot;.html&quot; extension so the file can be located.\nUPDATE: Retaining the query string\nTo retain query strings and arguments passed to a  page, the  statement can be changed to:\n\nThis should allow requests such as  to redirect to  instead of just .\n\nNote that this is considered safe usage of the `if` directive.\nFrom the NGINX page If Is Evil:\n\nThe only 100% safe things which may be done inside if in a location context are:\nreturn ...;\nrewrite ... last;\n\n\nAlso, note that you may swap out the &#39;302&#39; redirect for a &#39;301&#39;.\nA  redirect is permanent, and is cached by web browsers and search engines. If your goal is to permanently remove the  extension from pages that are already indexed by a search engine, you will want to use a  redirect. However, if you are testing on a live site, it is best practice to start with a  and only move to a  when you are absolutely confident your configuration is working correctly.\n",

However, software engineers have added many extensions that take these implementations far beyond the formal definition. So, while most regular expression engines resemble one another, there is actually no standard. For this reason, a lot depends on what language, API, framework or library you are using.\n(Incidentally, to help reduce confusion, many have taken to using &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot; to describe these enhanced matching languages. See Is a Regex the Same as a Regular Expression? at RexEgg.com for more information.)\nThat said, most regex engines (actually, all of them, as far as I know) would accept . Most likely, there&#39;s an issue with escaping.\nThe Trouble with Escaping\nSome languages have built-in support for regexes, such as JavaScript. For those languages that don&#39;t, escaping can be a problem.\nThis is because you are basically coding in a language within a language. Java, for example, uses  as an escape character within it&#39;s strings, so if you want to place a literal backslash character within a string, you must escape it:\n\nHowever, regexes also use the  character for escaping, so if you want to match a literal  character, you must escape it for the regex engine, and then escape it again for Java:\n\nIn your case, you have probably not escaped the backslash character in the language you are programming in:\n\nAll this escaping can get very confusing. If the language you are working with supports raw strings, then you should use those to cut down on the number of backslashes, but not all languages do (most notably: Java). Fortunately, there&#39;s an alternative that will work some of the time:\n\nFor a regex engine,  and  mean exactly the same thing. Note that this doesn&#39;t work in every case, like newline (), open square bracket () and backslash ( or ).\nA Note about Matching Numbers\n(Hint: It&#39;s harder than you think)\nMatching a number is one of those things you&#39;d think is quite easy with regex, but it&#39;s actually pretty tricky. Let&#39;s take a look at your approach, piece by piece:\n\nMatch an optional  or \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\n\nMatch an optional \n\nMatch 0 or more sequential digits\nFirst, we can clean up this expression a bit by using a character class shorthand for the digits (note that this is also susceptible to the escaping issue mentioned above):\n = \nI&#39;m going to use  below, but keep in mind that it means the same thing as . (Well, actually, in some engines  will match digits from all scripts, so it&#39;ll match more than  will, but that&#39;s probably not significant in your case.)\nNow, if you look at this carefully, you&#39;ll realize that every single part of your pattern is optional. This pattern can match a 0-length string; a string composed only of  or ; or, a string composed only of a . This is probably not what you&#39;ve intended.\nTo fix this, it&#39;s helpful to start by &quot;anchoring&quot; your regex with the bare-minimum required string, probably a single digit:\n\nNow we want to add the decimal part, but it doesn&#39;t go where you think it might:\n\nThis will still match values like . Worse, it&#39;s got a tinge of evil about it. The period is optional, meaning that you&#39;ve got two repeated classes side-by-side ( and ). This can actually be dangerous if used in just the wrong way, opening your system up to DoS attacks.\nTo fix this, rather than treating the period as optional, we need to treat it as required (to separate the repeated character classes) and instead make the entire decimal portion optional:\n\nThis is looking better now. We require a period between the first sequence of digits and the second, but there&#39;s a fatal flaw: we can&#39;t match  because a leading digit is now required.\nThis is actually pretty easy to fix. Instead of making the &quot;decimal&quot; portion of the number optional, we need to look at it as a sequence of characters: 1 or more numbers that may be prefixed by a  that may be prefixed by 0 or more numbers:\n\nNow we just add the sign:\n\nOf course, those slashes are pretty annoying in Java, so we can substitute in our long-form character classes:\n\nMatching versus Validating\nThis has come up in the comments a couple times, so I&#39;m adding an addendum on matching versus validating.\nThe goal of matching is to find some content within the input (the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;). The goal of validating is to ensure that the input is in an expected format.\nRegexes, by their nature, only match text. Given some input, they will either find some matching text or they will not. However, by &quot;snapping&quot; an expression to the beginning and ending of the input with anchor tags ( and ), we can ensure that no match is found unless the entire input matches the expression, effectively using regexes to validate.\nThe regex described above () will match one or more numbers within a target string. So given the input:\n\nThe regex will match , , ,  and .\nTo validate that a given input is a number and nothing but a number, &quot;snap&quot; the expression to the start and end of the input by wrapping it in anchor tags:\n\nThis will only find a match if the entire input is a floating point number, and will not find a match if the input contains additional characters. So, given the input , a match will be found, but given  no matches will be found.\nNote that some regex engines have a ,  or similar function, which essentially does what I&#39;ve described automatically, returning  if a match is found and  if no match is found. Also keep in mind that some engines allow you to set flags which change the definition of  and , matching the beginning/end of a line rather than the beginning/end of the entire input. This is typically not the default, but be on the lookout for these flags.\n",

            "body": "You can read this blog post that explains what most C# MIME parsers get wrong and why MimeKit can handle multiple charset encodings.\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/time-for-rant-on-mime-parsers.html\nhttps://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-decoding-rfc2047-encoded-headers-is.html\nTime for a rant on mime parsers...\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\nWhere should I begin?\nI guess I should start by saying that I am obsessed with MIME and, in particular, MIME parsers. No, really. I am obsessed. Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ve written and/or worked on several MIME parsers at this point. It started off in my college days working on Spruce which had a horrendously bad MIME parser, and so as you read farther along in my rant about shitty MIME parsers, keep in mind: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve written a shitty MIME parser.\nAs a handful of people are aware, I&#39;ve recently started implementing a C# MIME parser called MimeKit. As I work on this, I&#39;ve been searching around on GitHub and Google to see what other MIME parsers exist out there to find out what sort of APIs they provide. I thought perhaps I&#39;ll find one that offers a well-designed API that will inspire me. Perhaps, by some miracle, I&#39;d find one that was actually pretty good that I could just contribute to instead of writing my own from scratch (yea, wishful thinking). Instead, all I have found are poorly designed and implemented MIME parsers, many probably belong on the front page of the Daily WTF.\nI guess I&#39;ll start with some softballs.\nFirst, there&#39;s the fact that every single one of them was written as  parsers. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ones claiming to be &quot;stream parsers&quot;, because all any of those did was to slap a  on top of the byte stream and start using . What&#39;s so bad about that, you ask? For those not familiar with MIME, I&#39;d like for you to take a look at the raw email sources in your inboxes particularly if you have correspondence with anyone outside of the US. Hopefully, most of your friends and colleagues are using more-or-less MIME compliant email clients, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find at least a few emails with raw 8bit text.\nNow, if the language they were using was C or C++, they might be able to get away with doing this because they&#39;d technically be operating on byte arrays, but with Java and C#, a &#39;string&#39; is a unicode string. Tell me: how does one get a unicode string from a raw byte array?\nBingo. You need to know the charset before you can convert those bytes into unicode characters.\nTo be fair, there&#39;s really no good way of handling raw 8bit text in message headers, but by using a  approach, you are really limiting the possibilities.\nNext up is the  approach. One of the 2 early parsers in GMime (pan-mime-parser.c back in the version 0.7 days) used a  approach, so I understand the thinking behind this. And really, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this approach as far as correctness goes, it&#39;s more of a &quot;this can never be fast&quot; complaint. Of the two early parsers in GMime, the pan-mime-parser.c backend was horribly slow compared to the in-memory parser. Of course, that&#39;s not very surprising. More surprising to me at the time was that when I wrote GMime&#39;s current generation of the parser (sometime between v0.7 and v1.0), it was just as fast as the in-memory parser ever was and only ever had up to 4k in a read buffer at any given time. My point is, there are far better approaches than  if you want your parser to be reasonably performant... and why wouldn&#39;t you want that? Your users definitely want that.\nOkay, now come the more serious problems that I encountered in nearly all of the mime parser libraries I found.\nI think that every single mime parser I&#39;ve found so far uses the &quot;String.Split()&quot; approach for parsing address headers and/or for parsing parameter lists on headers such as Content-Type and Content-Disposition.\nHere&#39;s an example from one C# MIME parser:\n\nHere&#39;s how this same parser decodes encoded-word tokens:\n\nWhat?! It completely throws away the charset in each of those encoded-word tokens. In the case of quoted-printable tokens, it assumes they are all ASCII (actually, latin1 may work as well?) and in the case of base64 encoded-word tokens, it assumes they are all in UTF-7!?!? Where in the world did he get that idea? I can&#39;t begin to imagine his code working on any base64 encoded-word tokens in the real world. &#129318;‍♂️\nI&#39;d just like to point out that this is what this project&#39;s description states:\nA small, efficient, and working mime parser library written in c#.\n...\nI&#39;ve used several open-source mime parsers before, but they all either\nfail on one kind of encoding or the other, or miss some crucial\ninformation. That&#39;s why I decided to finally have a go at the problem\nmyself.\nI&#39;ll grant you that his MIME parser is small, but I&#39;d have to take issue with the &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;working&quot; adjectives. With the heavy use of string allocations and regex matching, it could hardly be considered &quot;efficient&quot;. And as the code pointed out above illustrates, &quot;working&quot; is a bit of an overstatement.\nFolks... this is what you get when you opt for a &quot;lightweight&quot; MIME parser because you think that parsers like GMime are &quot;bloated&quot;.\nOn to parser #2... I like to call this the &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; approach:\n\nI&#39;ll give this guy some credit, at least he saw that his  approach was flawed and so tried to compensate by piecing Humpty Dumpty back together again. Of course, with his String.Trim()ing, he just won&#39;t be able to put him back together again with any level of certainty. The white space in those quoted tokens may have significant meaning.\nMany of the C# MIME parsers out there like to use Regex all over the place. Here&#39;s a snippet from one parser that is entirely written in Regex (yea, have fun maintaining that...):\n\nLet&#39;s pretend that the regex pattern strings are correct in their definitions (because they are god-awful to read and I can&#39;t be bothered to double-check them), the replacing of &#39;_&#39; with a space is wrong (it should only be done in the &quot;q&quot; case) and the  is just evil. Not to mention that there could be multiple encoded words per field.Body which this code utterly fails to handle.\nGuys. I know you love regular expressions and that they are very very useful, but they are no substitute for writing a real tokenizer. This is especially true if you want to be lenient in what you accept (and in the case of MIME, you really need to be).\n",

            "body": "Why Are Evil Regexes A Problem?\nBecause computers do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it&#39;s not what you meant or is totally unreasonable. If you ask a regex engine to prove that, for some given input, there either is or is not a match for a given pattern, then the engine will attempt to do that no matter how many different combinations must be tested.\nHere is a simple pattern inspired by the first example in the OP&#39;s post:\n\nGiven the input:\n\nabababababababababababab\n\nThe regex engine tries something like  and a match is found on the first try.\nBut then we throw the monkey wrench in:\n\nabababababababababababab a\n\nThe engine will first try  but that fails because of that extra . This causes catastrophic backtracking, because our pattern , in a show of good faith, will release one of its captures (it will &quot;backtrack&quot;) and let the outer pattern try again. For our regex engine, that looks something like this:\n\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n - Nope\n\nThe number of possible combinations scales exponentially with the length of the input and, before you know it, the regex engine is eating up all your system resources trying to solve this thing until, having exhausted every possible combination of terms, it finally gives up and reports &quot;There is no match.&quot; Meanwhile your server has turned into a burning pile of molten metal.\nHow to Spot Evil Regexes\nIt&#39;s actually very tricky. Catastrophic backtracking in modern regex engines is similar in nature to the halting problem which Alan Turing proved was impossible to solve. I have written problematic regexes myself, even though I know what they are and generally how to avoid them. Wrapping everything you can in an atomic group can help to prevent the backtracking issue. It basically tells the regex engine not to revisit a given expression - &quot;lock whatever you matched on the first try&quot;. Note, however, that atomic expressions don&#39;t prevent backtracking within the expression, so  is still dangerous, but  is safe (it&#39;ll match  and then refuse to give up any of it&#39;s matched characters, thus preventing catastrophic backtracking).\nUnfortunately, once it&#39;s written, it&#39;s actually very hard to immediately or quickly find a problem regex. In the end, recognizing a bad regex is like recognizing any other bad code - it takes a lot of time and experience and/or a single catastrophic event.\n\nInterestingly, since this answer was first written, a team at the University of Texas at Austin published a paper describing the development of a tool capable of performing static analysis of regular expressions with the express purpose of finding these &quot;evil&quot; patterns. The tool was developed to analyse Java programs, but I suspect that in the coming years we&#39;ll see more tools developed around analysing and detecting problematic patterns in JavaScript and other languages, especially as the rate of ReDoS attacks continues to climb.\n\nStatic Detection of DoS Vulnerabilities in\nPrograms that use Regular Expressions\nValentin W&#252;stholz, Oswaldo Olivo, Marijn J.

If you have only a limited number of possible functions, the safest thing to do is to simply map them, and then separate the wanted function and the arguments in the variable, using an array instead. More on that later.\nIf you wanted to provide a generic means for calling functions, you could for example:\n\nI&#39;m using  here, since  is a language statement and not a function, and therefore wouldn&#39;t work like this. If you had to echo here, you&#39;d have to make your own echo wrapper function, like , and call that instead.\nOr, for more readable code, you could list the array as:\n\nIf you needed multiple arguments, you could use this structure:\n\nWhere the arguments listed in the arguments array, unpacked with the splat operator, are in the same order as the target function&#39;s arguments.\nThere are of course only a limited number of useful functions that will directly output anything. Therefore, in the above example we capture the result from  instead and then echo; this simply to illustrate the basic use of variable functions and arguments.\nThis approach will however provide unhinged access to any function in your system, and as such shouldn&#39;t be used on anything but data/calls from trusted sources (you). Allowing users to provide any commands will open up your system to a world of mischief and misery.\nTherefore, my initial recommendation of providing a map of functions. You could:\n\nHave an array with a list of allowed core functions,\nHave an array with a list of your custom wrapper functions, or\nCheck for valid wrapper functions named with a prefix\n\nYou could for example implement wrappers as follows:\n\nThis would give you control over what&#39;s executed, and also whether values are returned or output, etc. pre/post-process. And then iterate your variable commands as follows:\n\nFor an additional layer of insulation, create a class with your custom calls as its methods, instead of polluting the global space with more functions. Ciykd use a public router method that handles no-match cases; calling e.g. , where  returns the  methods.\nI often do something like this when I need to map user requests to class public methods that return output; named e.g. ,  etc. and  for a fallback for unmatched requests.

            "body": "PEP 585 -- Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections claims usability under both Python 3.7 and 3.8 with a standard  preamble. Notably:\n\nFor use cases restricted to type annotations, Python files with the  future-import (available since Python 3.7) can parameterize standard collections, including builtins.\n\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, when  is used, function and variable annotations can parameterize standard collections directly. Example:\n\n\nWhile the above toy example does technically parse, that&#39;s about all it does. Attempting to actually use a parametrized builtin collection at runtime under either Python 3.7 or 3.8 invariably raises the dreaded  exception:\n\nNote the  statement is the standard idiom for resolving PEP 563-style postponed annotations at runtime. Don&#39;t even get me started on PEP 563.\nwho you gonna believe: me or your lying PEP?\nThis discourages the devout Pythonista in me. PEP 585 repeatedly claims that it preserves runtime usability:\n\nPreserving the generic type at runtime enables introspection of the type which can be used for API generation or runtime type checking. Such usage is already present in the wild.\n\n\nJust like with the  module today, the parameterized generic types listed in the previous section all preserve their type parameters at runtime:\n\n\nOf course, none of the above works under Python 3.7 or 3.8 – regardless of whether  is enabled or not:\n\nSo PEP 585 blatantly breaks the wild and all existing attempts to introspect generic types at runtime – especially from runtime type checkers. The entire &quot;Parameters to generics are available at runtime&quot; section is a charade.\nAm I missing something painfully obvious or are parametrized builtin collections the poison pill they superficially appear to be? Since evaluating these collections at runtime under Python 3.7 and 3.8 unconditionally raises exceptions, they&#39;re unusable at runtime – rendering them not simply useless but directly harmful for the widespread use case of type introspection and especially runtime type checking.\nbetween a rock and a hard PEP\nAny codebase type-hinting with parametrized builtin collections will be fundamentally incompatible with runtime type checkers under Python 3.7 and 3.8. Codebases preferring runtime to static type checking while preserving backward compatibility with Python &lt; 3.9 (which has yet to even be officially released as of this writing) thus have no choice but to avoid parametrized builtin collections entirely.\nExcept that too is infeasible. Why? Because PEP 585 deprecates the entire hierarchy of  pseudo-containers:\n\nImporting those [e.g., , , ] from  is deprecated. Due to PEP 563 and the intention to minimize the runtime impact of , this deprecation will not generate . Instead, type checkers may warn about such deprecated usage when the target version of the checked program is signalled to be Python 3.9 or newer. It&#39;s recommended to allow for those warnings to be silenced on a project-wide basis.\n\n\nThe deprecated functionality will be removed from the  module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0.\n\nConsider , for example. By 2025 (or shortly thereafter),  and thus  goes away. But  isn&#39;t safely parametrizable under Python 3.7 and 3.8, because doing so renders your project incompatible with anything that introspects types. So  isn&#39;t a viable option, either.\nSo there are no forward- and backward-compatible options. Instead, either:\n\nProhibit type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) entirely by just preferring builtin containers (e.g., ) to  pseudo-containers (e.g., ) or...\nSupport type introspection (and thus runtime type checking) by either:\n\nPreferring  pseudo-containers to builtin containers until 2025. At that time, both the project in question and all downstream projects of that project will need to be refactored as follows:\n\nDrop Python 3.7 and 3.8 support.\nReplace all  pseudo-containers with builtin containers.\n\n\nImmediately dropping Python 3.7 and 3.8 support by preferring builtin containers to  pseudo-containers. This has the distasteful disadvantage of requiring a currently unstable Python interpreter, but... that&#39;s technically an option. Somehow.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, there are no good options – only a spectrum of increasingly horrifying lessers of several malignant evils. One would hope that PEP authors would actually test their implementations at runtime. Yet, here we are, adrift without a paddle in a steaming cesspit of theorycrafted anti-APIs. Welcome to Python.\nbut that&#39;s not all\nThere is technically a third way. It&#39;s even more distasteful – but it should technically work. One awful theorycrafting deserves another, I always say!\nSince PEP 563-driven postponed annotations are merely strings, type introspection could cleverly run a regex-based replacement on each type being introspected. For each type that is a postponed annotation, globally replace each substring referencing a parametrized builtin container (e.g., ) in that annotation string with the corresponding substring referencing a parametrized  pseudo-container (e.g., ).\nThe result? A Python 3.7- and 3.8-compatible postponed annotation string safely evaluatable until 2025, at which point that internal replacement (and Python 3.7 and 3.8 support) could just be quietly dropped.\nThat&#39;s a totally cray-cray ludicrous speed kludge for the stars, but... that would probably work. The core issue, of course, is that one shouldn&#39;t need insane hackery just to comply with core official PEPs. But there&#39;s an even deeper underlying cultural issue underneath that technical issue. No one – neither the author of PEP 585 nor any of the commentators reviewing PEP 585 – actually tested their new hypothetical proposed functionality before deprecating the existing well-tested functionality that actually worked.\nCore official PEPs should just work out of the box. Increasingly, they don&#39;t. And that should concern everyone.\n",

Because regexes are strings, it must be escaped: .\n\nFrom a lexical/syntactic standpoint it is true that  could be used unambiguously (as a bonus it would prevent the need for the &quot;evil escaped escape&quot; when using back references). \n\nTo match a  that comes after the end of a line the regex would need to be :\n\n\n\nIt just makes more sense to use a familiar syntax instead of changing the rules, most of which came from Perl.\n\nThe first version of Perl came out in 1987, which is much earlier than Java, which was released in beta in 1995. \n\nI dug up the man pages for Perl 1, which say:\n\n\n  The bracketing construct  may also be used, in which case  matches the &#39;th substring. (Outside of the pattern, always use  instead of  in front of the digit. The scope of  (and ,  and ) extends to the end of the enclosing BLOCK or eval string, or to the next pattern match with subexpressions. The  notation sometimes works outside the current pattern, but should not be relied upon.) You may have as many parentheses as you wish. If you have more than 9 substrings, the variables , , ... refer to the corresponding substring. Within the pattern, , , etc. refer back to substrings if there have been at least that many left parens before the backreference. Otherwise (for backward compatibilty)  is the same as , a backspace, and  the same as , a tab. And so on. ( through  are always backreferences.)\n\n",

In order to use a regular expression to search for regular expression meta-characters (?, +, *, [, ], ., et al), you must either:\n\n\nEscape the meta-characters with backslashes to avoid pattern\ncollisions (Example: ), or\nChange the regular expression pattern delimiter to avoid a pattern collision, or\nBoth (This is what you should do in this case).\n\n\nIn sed, you can change the regex pattern delimiter by escaping a character before your pattern begins.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nPoint 3:\n\nYou can search for strings as a  with regular expressions in sed! By definition, the most basic pattern is a sequence of characters. However, you must adhere to point number two above and escape any regex meta-characters, or the default pattern delimiter, /, if necessary.\n\nSolution 1:\n\nYour evil, I mean regex pattern, has regex meta-characters and the default pattern delimiter embedded in it!\n\n\n\nI would prescribe the following. Notice that I am now using double quotes because I want the shell to do variable interpolation before executing .

Most people are not.\nBut I am. ☻\n\nGeneral Regex-Based HTML Parsing Solutions\nFirst I’ll show how easy it is to parse arbitrary HTML with regexes. The full program’s at the end of this posting, but the heart of the parser is:\n\nSee how easy that is to read?\nAs written, it identifies each piece of HTML and tells  where it found that piece. You could easily modify it to do whatever else you want with any given type of piece, or for more particular types than these.\nI have no failing test cases (left :): I’ve successfully run this code on more than 100,000 HTML files — every single one I could quickly and easily get my hands on. Beyond those, I’ve also run it on files specifically constructed to break na&#239;ve parsers.\nThis is not a na&#239;ve parser.\nOh, I’m sure it isn’t perfect, but I haven’t managed to break it yet.  I figure that even if something did, the fix would be easy to fit in because of the program’s clear structure. Even regex-heavy programs should have stucture.\nNow that that’s out of the way, let me address the OP’s question.\nDemo of Solving the OP’s Task Using Regexes\nThe little  program I include below produces the following output, so that you can see that parsing HTML with regexes works just fine for what you wish to do:\n\nParse Input Tags, See No Evil Input\nHere’s the source for the program that produced the output above.\n\nThere you go! Nothing to it! :)\nOnly  you can judge whether your skill with regexes is up to any particular parsing task. Everyone’s level of skill is different, and every new task is different. For jobs where you have a well-defined input set, regexes are obviously the right choice, because it is trivial to put some together when you have a restricted subset of HTML to deal with. Even regex beginners should be handle those jobs with regexes.  Anything else is overkill.\nHowever, once the HTML starts becoming less nailed down, once it starts to ramify in ways you cannot predict but which are perfectly legal, once you have to match more different sorts of things or with more complex dependencies, you will eventually reach a point where you have to work harder to effect a solution that uses regexes than you would have to using a parsing class. Where that break-even point falls  depends again on your own comfort level with regexes.\nSo What Should I Do?\nI’m not going to tell you what you must do or what you cannot do.  I think that’s Wrong. I just want to present you with possibilties, open your eyes a bit. You get to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. There are no absolutes — and nobody else knows your own situation as well as you yourself do. If something seems like it’s too much work, well, maybe it is.  Programming should be fun, you know. If it isn’t, you may be doing it wrong.\nOne can look at my  program in any number of valid ways.  One such is that you indeed can parse HTML with regular expressions. But another is that it is much, much, much harder than almost anyone ever thinks it is. This can easily lead to the conclusion that my program is a testament to what you should not do, because it really is too hard.\nI won’t disagree with that.  Certainly if everything I do in my program doesn’t make sense to you after some study, then you should not be attempting to use regexes for this kind of task. For specific HTML, regexes are great, but for generic HTML, they’re tantamount to madness. I use parsing classes all the time, especially if it’s HTML I haven’t generated myself.\nRegexes  optimal for small HTML parsing problems,  pessimal for large ones\nEven if my program is taken as  illustrative of why you should not use regexes for parsing general HTML — which is OK, because I kinda meant for it to be that ☺  — it still should be an eye-opener so more people break the terribly common and nasty, nasty habit of writing unreadable, unstructured, and unmaintainable patterns.\nPatterns do not have to be ugly, and they do not have to be hard. If you create ugly patterns, it is a reflection on you, not them.\nPhenomenally Exquisite Regex Language\nI’ve been asked to point out that my proferred solution to your problem has been written in Perl. Are you surprised? Did you not notice? Is this revelation a bombshell?\nIt is true that not all other tools and programming languages are quite as convenient, expressive, and powerful when it comes to regexes as Perl is. There’s a big spectrum out there, with some being more suitable than others.  In general, the languages that have expressed regexes as part of the core language instead of as a library are easier to work with. I’ve done nothing with regexes that you couldn’t do in, say, PCRE, although you would structure the program differently if you were using C.\nEventually other languages will be catch up with where Perl is now in terms of regexes.  I say this because back when Perl started, nobody else had anything like Perl’s regexes. Say anything you like, but this is where Perl clearly won: everybody copied Perl’s regexes albeit at varying stages of their development.  Perl pioneered almost (not quite all, but almost) everything that you have come to rely on in modern patterns today, no matter what tool or language you use.  So eventually the others will catch up.\nBut they’ll only catch up to where Perl was sometime in the past, just as it is now.  Everything advances.  In regexes if nothing else, where Perl leads, others follow. Where will Perl be once everybody else finally catches up to where Perl is now?  I have no idea, but I know we too will have moved. Probably we’ll be closer to Perl₆’s style of crafting patterns.\nIf you like that kind  of thing but would like to use it in Perl₅,  you might be interested in Damian Conway’s wonderful Regexp::Grammars module. It’s completely awesome, and makes what I’ve done here in my program seem just as primitive as mine makes the patterns that people cram together without whitespace or alphabetic identifiers.  Check it out!\n\nSimple HTML Chunker\nHere is the complete source to the parser I showed the centerpiece from at the beginning of this posting.\nI am not suggesting that you should use this over a rigorously tested parsing class. But I am tired of people pretending that nobody can parse HTML with regexes just because they can’t. You clearly can, and this program is proof of that assertion.\nSure,  it isn’t easy, but it is possible!\nAnd trying to do so is a terrible waste of time, because good parsing classes exist which you should use for this task.  The right answer to people trying to parse arbitrary HTML is not that it is impossible.  That is a facile and disingenuous answer.  The correct and honest answer is that they shouldn’t attempt it because it is too much of a bother to figure out from scratch; they should not  break their back striving to re&#239;nvent a wheel that works perfectly well.\nOn the other hand, HTML that falls within a predicable subset is ultra-easy to parse with regexes. It’s no wonder people try to use them, because for small problems, toy problems perhaps, nothing could be easier. That’s why it’s so important to distinguish the two tasks — specific vs generic — as these do not necessarily demand the same approach.\nI hope in the future here to see a more fair and honest treatment of questions about HTML and regexes.\nHere’s my HTML lexer.  It doesn’t try to do a validating parse; it just identifies the lexical elements. You might think of it more as an HTML chunker than an HTML parser. It isn’t very forgiving of broken HTML, although it makes some very small allowances in that direction.\nEven if you never parse full HTML yourself (and why should you? it’s a solved problem!), this program has lots of cool regex bits that I believe a lot of people can learn a lot from.

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nYou may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\nFinally, many PHP frameworks including Symfony, Zend and Laravel (there is no mention of this in the coding guidelines but it follows the suit) and the PSR-2 standard (item 2.2) require omission of the closing tag. PHP manual itself (1,2), Wordpress, Drupal and many other PHP software I guess, advise to do so. If you simply make a habit of following the standard (and setup PHP-CS-Fixer for your code) you can forget the issue. Otherwise you will always need to keep the issue in your mind.\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after . An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

            "body": "There doesn&#39;t seem to be a great answer for this, after trying many things.\nIf there is an answer to the question it might be that there&#39;s no good way to do it. I think it doesn&#39;t hurt to look at potential solutions though and the drawbacks of each one.\n\nSolution 1\n\nUse componentWillUpdate. This is deprecated.\n\nSolution 2\n\nValidate state on render - but in your case and in most others, validation may lead to setState, which react tells you never to do in render(), but doesn&#39;t go into any detail about what will actually happen. Of course, you would have to be careful to prevent infinite loops, but if you call setState in render() upon some condition which cannot logically result in an infinite loop, then what unintended side effects could occur? \n\nSolution 3\n\nAs above, make a wrapper function to both validate and set state. But this is no good in my opinion because any state changes done with set state directly cannot be validated. Not only does setState directly not call your validation, but your validation also does not run on the items in the initial state. You might say, why would you give your component an initial state that&#39;s invalid, but I don&#39;t care, if I want to validate state I want it to validate 50000% of the time and no less.\n\nIn a complex form example, there are other issues with this. What if the validity of one field depends on the state of another field? Surely then, a function to re-validate a field when it changes is not enough. Some people will say to test the field being passed in and dispatch multiple events for re-validation, but again, this just isn&#39;t acceptable to me. Its not fullproof, it can lead to bugs, and make things hard to test. \n\nSolution 4\n\nUse componentWillReceiveProps. Not only is this deprecated, but its also static, meaning that you don&#39;t have access to the component instance. For some components this is fine because you can still modify the state that is returned, but if your component has data outside of state and props then you cannot access it, in addition to not being able to use non-static methods, which in my opinion makes this method pretty useless in many situations.\n\nSolution 5\n\nHaven&#39;t tested this one (bear with me, its fairly nuts), but you can override setState function in your component. Insert a callback into every setState instance. Track how many times setState is called and how many times the setState callback is called. Inside the callback, you can check the two counters stored in the object to see if the last callback is currently running, then, if it is, run one function which validates all state. On render, set both of the counters back down to zero. I don&#39;t recommend this by any means. It may work but its a pretty major hack.\n\nSolution 6\n\nYou can use componentDidUpdate, but this is inefficient. You will be blindly setting state with a value that was not validated then letting your component render only to validate it after and possibly call render again. Once again you have to be careful to avoid infinite loop while calling setState in componentDidUpdate. I read elsewhere that at least if you set the state here, the DOM will only re-draw once. In other words, it doesn&#39;t draw immediately after render() but waits until componentDidUpdate is triggered and re-calls render if state changes in there. This seems like maybe its the only solution I know about that react only warns about without telling you explicitely not to do this. In your case, the efficiency does not matter, but what if the state you were trying to validate was a 100 field form with a very expensive render method. Now, on every key down you&#39;ve essentially doubled the amount of work that react has to do to render your components, causing them to first render without being validated, and then filtering and/or validating them for a very likely second render.\n\nAdditional Issues\n\nIn my case, i&#39;m working on a form and not a simple component like you described above. I may go with a mix of solution 3 and 5. Its more complicated then I want though. It involves using one function to filter, generate errors, and set the state for each field (ie. solution 3). And then on componenetDidUpdate I may look for state keys whose values are different from the last value that the field was validated with. The second step here has many ways of doing so, all of which are messy and inefficient. To make it worse, they practically never run under normal circumstances because I always use the first function to update and validate their state, so this makes testing it harder. It&#39;s like leaving some fallback in my app that seems to work but during the entire development process it never triggers except for like the one time that I decided to test it. Seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nThere are additional efficiency concerns I also won&#39;t get into which relates to trying not to re-validate a field if it has the same value it was validated with last time. This is a whole other can of worms, but basically what it boils down to is that you should be able to not only validate a state before render, but you should have access to the previous state as well, so you can save some cpu time and only validate the fields that changed. For example, if you have a very long textarea with some complex regex, it would be nice to not validate that on every component render even if its a separate field that is changing.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nI&#39;m very thoroughly disappointed that react seems to provide no legitimate option for this. Seeing as you can call setState many times in one operation, and each one will be queued, how is it that they don&#39;t provide us with one callback after all state changes are resolved and we&#39;re about to render? Well if you think about it, the render function itself is this callback, because I think its only ever called after setStates are resolved, but again, its evil to call setState on render, and it would be a million times cleaner to have render() simply receive the correct state, so I don&#39;t see how this is very useful.\n\nDoes anyone know why they decided to get rid of componentWillUpdate?\n",

            "body": "Short answer: Don&#39;t (re)build a parser in Node.js, use the browser instead\n\nI strongly advise against evaluating or parsing crawled data in Node.js if you are anyway using puppeteer for crawling. When you are using puppeteer you already have a browser with a great sandbox for JavaScript code running in another process. Why risk that kind of isolation and &quot;rebuild&quot; a parser in your Node.js script? If your Node.js script breaks, your whole script will fail. In the worst case, you might even expose your machine to serious risks when you try to run untrusted code inside your main thread.\n\nInstead, try to do as much parsing as possible inside the context of the page. You can even do an evil  call there. There worst that could happen? Your browser hangs or crashes.\n\nExample\n\nImagine the following HTML page (very much simplified). You are trying to read the text which is pushed into an array. The only information you have is that there is an additional attribute  which is set to .\n\n\n\nBad code\n\nHere is a simple example what your code might look like right now:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the script extracts the JavaScript code from the page. Now we have the JavaScript code from the page and we &quot;only&quot; need to parse it, right? Well, this is the wrong approach. Don&#39;t try to rebuild a parser inside Node.js. Just use the browser. There are basically two approaches you can take to do that in your case.\n\n\nInject proxy functions into the page and fake some built-in functions (recommended)\nParse the data on the client-side (!) by using , a regex or  (eval only if really necessary)\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Inject proxy functions into the page\n\nIn this approach you are replacing native browser functions with your own &quot;fake functions&quot;. Example:\n\n\n\nThis code replaces the original  function with our own function. Everything works as normal, but when an item with our target id is pushed into an array, a special condition is triggered. To inject this function into the page, you could use . To receive the data from Node.js you would have to expose a function to the browser via :\n\n\n\nNow it doesn&#39;t really matter how complex the code of the page is, whether it happens inside some asynchronous handler or whether the page changes the surrounding code. As long as the target data is pushing the data into an array, we will get it.\n\nYou can use this approach for a lot of crawling. Check how the data is processed and replace the low level functions processing the data with your own proxy version of it.\n\nOption 2: Parse the data\n\nLet&#39;s assume the first approach does not work for some reason. The data is in some script tag, but you are not able to get it by using fake functions.\n\nThen you should parse the data, but not inside your Node.js environment. Do it inside the page context. You could run a regular expression or use . But do it before returning the data back to Node.js. This approach has the benefit that if your code will crash your environment for some reason, it will not be your main script, but just your browser that crashes.\n\nTo give some example code. Instead of running the code from the original &quot;bad code&quot; sample, we change it to this:\n\n\n\nThis will only return the parts of the code we need, which can then be fruther processed from within Node.js.\n\n\n\nIndependent of which approach you choose, both ways are much better and more secure than running unknown code inside your main thread. If you absolutely have to process the data in your Node.js environment, use a regular expression for it like shown in the answer from trincot. You should never use eval to run untrusted code.\n",

One big advantage to a regex is that you can capture parts of the match and use them to modify the response.  Of course, you can usually achieve similar results with the other approaches by either setting a variable in the original block or using .  The downside of the regex approach is that it can get unwieldy if you want to match a variety of locations, plus the low precedence of a regex might just not fit with how you want to match locations —&#160;not to mention that  there are apparently performance impacts from regexes in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of including files (as far as I can tell) is that it is a little more flexible about exactly what you can include —&#160;it doesn&#39;t have to be a full location block, for example.  But it&#39;s also just subjectively a bit clunkier than named locations.\n\nAlso note that there is a related solution that you may be able to use in similar situations: nested locations.  The idea is that you would start with a very general location, apply some configuration common to several of the possible matches, and then have separate nested locations for the different types of paths that you want to match.

Basically, catastrophic backtracking happens when a regex fails to match and different permutations of the same regex can find a partial match.  The regex engine then tries all those permutations.  If you want to go over your code and inspect your regexes these are the 3 key issues to look at:\n\n\nAlternatives must be mutually exclusive.  If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails.  If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.  A classic example is  to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a &quot;dot matches line breaks&quot; mode.  If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces (matched by both  and ) will break the regex.  The fix is to use  to make the alternatives mutually exclusive or even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as  for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.\nQuantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive what comes between them.  Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match.  A classic example is  to match 3 things with &quot;anything&quot; between them. When  can&#39;t be matched the first  will expand character by character until the end of the line or file.  For each expansion the second  will expand character by character to match the remainder of the line or file.  The fix is to realize that you can&#39;t have &quot;anything&quot; between them.  The first run needs to stop at  and the second run needs to stop at .  With single characters  is an easy solution.  Since we now stop at the delimiter, we can use possessive quantifiers to further increase performance.\nA group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it.  That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.  This is the problem illustrated in JDB&#39;s answer.\n\n\nWhile I was writing my answer I decided that this merited a full article on my website.  This is now online too.\n",

They have a sweet point (mainly simple assignment or builtin operations). But if the actor is any kind of non-trivial you&#39;ll see the complexity ramp up quickly, not just for the human but also for the compiler. This leads to\n\n\nslow compilation\nsub-optimal emitted code\nharder to maintain source\nnew classes of error (e.g. when the expression templates hold references to locals/temporaries, something that Boost Proto (and hence Phoenix) does not prevent or signal. In fact, it encourages it by assuming all template expressions are ephemeral, but I digress).\n\n\n\n  Interestingly: Spirit X3 dropped Phoenix altogether, even though Phoenix was once the brain child of Spirit&#179;.\n  \n  The new style uses c++14 polymorphic lambdas, that look 90% like the helper function object in the original code, but inline as a lambda.\n\n\nThis specific case\n\nCan&#39;t work. At all.\n\nThe problem is that you&#39;re mixing lazy/deferred actors with direct invocations. That can never work. The type of  isn&#39;t supposed to be . Of course. It is supposed to be a lazy actor&#185; that can be used at some later time to create a . \n\nNow that we know that (and why)  is an actor type, it should become clear why it is completely bogus to call  on it. You might as well say\n\n\n\nAnd wonder why it would not compile.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should probably just have the dedicated functor. You can of course Phoenix-adapt the regex functions you require, but all it does is shift the complexity tax for some syntactic sugar.\n\nI&#39;d always opt for the more naive approach that is going to be more understandable to a seasoned c++ programmer, and avoids pitfalls that come with high-wire acts&#178;.\n\nNevertheless, here&#39;s a pointer should you be curious:\n\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/phoenix/modules/function.html\n\nLive On Coliru\n\n\n\n\n\n&#185; think composed function object that can be invoked at a later time\n\n&#178; the balance might tip if you were designing this as an EDSL for further configuration by non-experts, but then you will have the added responsibility of documenting your EDSL and the constraints in which it can be used\n\n&#179; should we say, spirit-child of a brain?\n",

            "body": "The worst input for a regular expression will vary from engine to engine. The same regex and string may take no time at all on one engine, but never finish on another.\n\nDifferences between engines\n\nEngine Type\n\nFor certain engines, the &quot;evilest&quot; regex is still benign, running in linear time (or  time when both the length of the regex and the length of the string may vary.) Of course, the reason for this is the implementation. These engines don&#39;t backtrack; instead they use a finite state machine (FSM).\n\nNote that some backtracking implementations use FSM, but only as an intermediate step. Don&#39;t let this confuse you; they&#39;re not FSM.\n\nMost of the old regex engines (like sed) use FSM matching. There are a few new engines that use this implementation, such as Go. PCRE even has DFA functions (search for &quot;DFA&quot; here) that use this type of matching.\n\nAnother answer of mine also addresses the potential speed difference between the two implementations.\n\nIt would be wise to consider using a FSM implementation if you are really worried about malicious input affecting the speed of your regex. Unfortunately, FSM is not as powerful as the other implementation; it lacks support for some features, such as back references.\n\nOptimizations\n\nEvil is actually a bit subjective. Something evil to one regex engine may not be evil to a different engine. An evil plot can be thwarted if the engine is optimized. Optimizations are particularly important to backtracking engines, given their potential exponential run time.\n\nShort-circuiting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the engine may be able to quickly determine a match is impossible. While running the regex  against the string , Regex101 says:\n\n\n  Your match failed outright. What this means is the engine, due to its internal optimizations, understood that your pattern would never match at any position, and thus did not even attempt to.\n\n\nKeep in mind that Wikipedia says the regex is evil, especially when paired with that string.\n\nOf course, the engine is smart to not need to backtrack to determine the match wouldn&#39;t work. It saw something pretty obvious: the regex needs an  in order to match, but no  was present in the string.\n\nModifiers\n\nI mention this because you might not expect modifiers to be a factor in regex performance. But they are.\n\nEven PCRE, one of the more optimized implementations, may take considerably more steps with both the  and  modifiers enabled. See my question here for more information about this. In the end, I figured out that only certain characters trigger this behavior.\n\nAnalyzing Strings\n\nString length\n\nIn general, a long string will be slower than a short string. In fact, if you find a string of length x that causes catastrophic backtracking, you can make it backtrack a bit more by increasing the length of the string.\n\nGreedy vs. Lazy\n\nCompare the speeds of these regexes:\n\n\n  on \n on \n  on \n on \n\n\nEssentially, greedy matching is best when you think you will need to match a lot. Lazy matching is best when you need to match only a little.\n\nNote that if you change the regex to  or , then the engine may optimize things considerably.\n\nBrute force testing\n\nThere are several frameworks that are specifically designed to try to find vulnerabilities in your regexes. It may be worthwhile to try one out.\n\nThere&#39;s really one thing that I will suggest if you wanted to try making your own algorithm. It&#39;s not practical to try all characters in the dictionary, especially if you want to test long strings.\n\nInstead, look at your regex to determine what characters you should test. If you have  as your regex, there are really only two things that go into the match:  and not . You could really just imagine that there are only two characters:  and  (aka not ) when you generate your strings to brute force with.\n\nSetting timeouts\n\nIt would be fantastic to be able to ensure your regex finishes before the heat death of the universe, right? Some regex engines do have a way to set a time out.\n\n.NET:\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\n\n  \n  \n  Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it exists, the  value defined in the .\n  \n  When called,  restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script execution a call such as  is made, the script will run for a total of 45 seconds before timing out.\n\n\nPerl\n\nYou might as well visit the link, since it&#39;s right on Stack Overflow.\n",

Rather than failing the whole match, though, it will &quot;rewind the tape&quot; and start with the second alternative, matching &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; and then &quot;z&quot;... success!\n\nBacktracking with Quantifiers\n\nThis also works with quantifiers. A quantifier is anything that encourages the engine to match a repeating pattern, including , ,  and  (depending on the engine).\n\nA greedy quantifier (the default) will match as many repetitions as possible before moving on to the rest of the pattern. For example, given the pattern and input below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern  will begin by matching the entire string: &quot;foobar&quot;. However, when it moves on to the , the regex engine has reach the end of the input and the match fails. Rather than simply giving up, the engine will ask the last greedy quantifier to give up one of its repetitions, now matching &quot;fooba&quot;. The match still fails, so the engine asks  to give up the &quot;a&quot; (failure), and then the &quot;b&quot;. After giving up the &quot;b&quot;, the engine can now match , and the match succeeds.\n\nTrees and Backtracking\n\nAnother way of thinking of a regex is as a &quot;tree&quot;, and backtracking is going back up a node and trying another path. Given the pattern  and the input &quot;foobaz&quot;, the engine will attempt something like the following:\n\n\n\nCounting the &quot;Backtracks&quot;\n\nAs to why you see differences in the &quot;number&quot; of backtracks... this probably has a lot to do with internal optimizations and logging level. For example, RegexBuddy does not appear to be logging the match to the empty string before , while regex101 does. In the end, though, it doesn&#39;t really matter what exact order you backtrack in (what order you climb back up the tree) so long as you end up with the same result.\n\nEvil Regexes\n\nYou already know this, but for the benefit of anyone else who happens by, your regex was written to demonstrate &quot;catastrophic backtracking&quot; (aka &quot;evil regex&quot;), where the number of backtrack attempts grows exponentially as the length of the input increases. These regexes can be exploited to perform DoS attacks, so you must use caution not to introduce these into your patterns (as I found out).\n",

Regexes can however &quot;extract&quot; data. Extracting is what they&#39;re made for. The major drawback of regex HTML extraction over proper SGML toolkits or baseline XML parsers are their syntactic effort and varying reliability.\n\nConsider that making a somewhat dependable HTML extraction regex:\n\n\n\nis way less readable than a simple phpQuery or QueryPath equivalent:\n\n\n\nThere are however specific use cases where they can help.\n\n\nMany DOM traversal frontends don&#39;t reveal HTML comments , which however are sometimes the more useful anchors for extraction. In particular pseudo-HTML variations  or SGML residues are easy to tame with regexps.\nOftentimes regular expressions can save post-processing. However HTML entities often require manual caretaking.\nAnd lastly, for extremely simple tasks like extracting &lt;img src= urls, they are in fact a probable tool. The speed advantage over SGML/XML parsers mostly just comes to play for these very basic extraction procedures.\n\n\nIt&#39;s sometimes even advisable to pre-extract a snippet of HTML using regular expressions  and process the remainder using the simpler HTML parser frontends.\n\nNote: I actually have this app, where I employ XML parsing and regular expressions alternatively. Just last week the PyQuery parsing broke, and the regex still worked. Yes weird, and I can&#39;t explain it myself. But so it happened.\nSo please don&#39;t vote real-world considerations down, just because it doesn&#39;t match the regex=evil meme. But let&#39;s also not vote this up too much.

            "body": "How regex alternation is implemented in Perl is fairly well explained in \n\n\n  Matching this or that\n  \n  We can match different character strings with the alternation\n  metacharacter  . To match  or  , we form the regex  .\n  As before, Perl will try to match the regex at the earliest possible\n  point in the string. At each character position, Perl will first try\n  to match the first alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match, Perl will\n  then try the next alternative,  . If  doesn&#39;t match either, then\n  the match fails and Perl moves to the next position in the string.\n  Some examples:\n\n\n  \n  Even though  is the first alternative in the second regex,  is able to match\n  earlier in the string.\n\n\n  \n  Here, all the alternatives match at the first string position, so the\n  first alternative is the one that matches. If some of the alternatives\n  are truncations of the others, put the longest ones first to give them\n  a chance to match.\n\n\n  \n  The last example points out \n  that character classes are like alternations of characters. At a given\n  character position, the first alternative that allows the regexp match\n  to succeed will be the one that matches.\n\n\nSo this should explain the price you pay when using alternations in regex.\n\nWhen putting simple regex together, you don&#39;t pay such a price. It&#39;s well explained in another related question in SO. When directly searching for a constant string, or a set of characters as in the question, optimizations can be done and no backtracking is needed which means potentially faster code.\n\nWhen defining the regex alternations, just choosing a good order (putting the most common findings first) can influence the performance. It is not the same either to choose between two options, or twenty. As always, premature optimization is the root of all evil and you should instrumentiate you code (Devel::NYTProf) if there are problems or you want improvements. But as a general rule alternations should be kept to a minimum and avoided if possible since:\n\n\nThey easily make the regex too big an complex. We like simple, easy to understand / debug / maintain regex.\nVariability and input dependant. They could be an unexpected source of problems since they backtrack and can lead to unexpected lack of performance depending on your input. As I understand, there&#39;s no case when they will be faster.\nConceptually you are trying to match two different things, so we could argue that two different statements are more correct and clear than just one.\n\n\nHope this answer gets closer to what you were expecting.\n",

First, the code:\n\n\n\nThe idea for this program is that the user enters an URL from Amazon or other sites like that and the program retrieves the image of the object, the sell price and (eventually) shipping fees. This is done by creating a sort of simple database ( will populate the list self.contenuti with some dictionaries containing the data). Now,  has to beahave exactly the same, no matter the site, and this is accomplished by creating specific classes (like the class ) that will have the specific functions for retrieving the data (every site has is own structure, so I can&#39;t use the same regex) and simply putting them in the dictionary : whenever  is called, the appropriate class (here I have only ) will be called passing  as an argument, and this will be the content of the site provided, converted into str, so the class Amazon can search the appropriate informations via regex.\n\nThis is for home uses, I already created a similar program that, with the data collected, writes a simple HTML file that is a sort of image gallery of all the objects of interest. What I want to do here, with , is downloading the image so it will be displayed into a tkinter label when I will write the GUI. No HTML file needed, the whole thing will be GUI based, like a sort of database.\n\nThe problem is that, whatever URL I provide (here I&#39;m doing it in the  function, for debug purposes) I get this evil and nasty &quot;thing&quot;: \n\n\n\nFrom what I understand, the problem is in urllib: for some reason the URL is not parsed correctly and I end up with the error. So, I tried to write this:\n\n\n\nThis is wrote in another module, for testing purpose, there is only this piece of code. If I have it for its own, it works perfectly, with no error.

The method name &#39;eval&#39; actually comes from the word &#39;evaluate&#39;, not evil.  Despite this, however, evaluation is not an objective in this scenario; parsing is.  \n\nAnother reason why people are hesitant to recommend eval for trivial tasks like data parsing is that the worst case scenario of JSON#parse is that it fails to parse.  Whereas the worst case scenario of eval is that you&#39;ve completely deleted your file system by parsing a string that you didn&#39;t expect to be there when you first designed your code.  \n",

            "body": "I have the following HTML and I need to remove the script tags and any script related attributes in the HTML. By script related attributes I mean any attribute that starts with on. \n\n\n\nMy first thought was to use BeautifulSoup to remove the tags and attributes. Unfortunately, I am unable to use BeautifulSoup. Seeing that BeautifulSoup is off the table I can see two options for doing this. The first option I see is splitting the strings and parsing based on index. This seems like a bad solution to me.\n\nThe other option is to use Regular Expressions. However, we know that isn&#39;t a good solution either (Cthulhu Parsing).\n\nNow with that in mind, I personally feel it is alright to use regular expressions to strip the attributes. After all, with those it is still simple string manipulation. \n\nSo for removing the attributes I have:\n\n\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I personally think the above perfectly acceptable use of Regular Expression with HTML. But still I would like to get some opinions on the above usage. \n\nThen there is the question of the script tags. I&#39;m very tempted to go with Regular Expressions for this because I know them and I know what I need is pretty simple. Something like:\n\n\n\nThe above would start to get me close to what I need. And yes I realize the above RegEx will grab everything starting at the first opening script tag until the last closing script tag, but it&#39;s a starting example. \n\nI&#39;m very tempted to use Regular Expressions as I&#39;m familiar with them (more so than Python) and I know that is the quickest way to achieve the results I want, at least for me it is. \n\nSo I need help to go against my nature and not be evil. I want to be evil and use RegEx so somebody please show me the light and guide me to the promised land on non-Regular Expressions.\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt looks like I wasn&#39;t very clear about what my question actually is, I apologize for that. My question is how can I parse the HTML using pure Python without Regular Expressions? \n\n\n\nAs for the above code example, it&#39;s wrong. I know it is wrong, I was using it as an example of a starting point. \n\nI hope this clears up my question some\n\nUpdate 2\n\nI just wanted to add a few more notes about what I am  doing. \n\nI am crawling a web site to get the data I need.\n\nOnce we have the page that contains the data we need it is saved to the database.\n\nThen the saved web page is displayed to the user.\n\nThe issue I am trying to solve happens here. The application throws a script error when you attempt to interact with the page that forces the user to click on a confirmation box. The application is not a web browser but uses the web browser DLL in Windows (I cannot remember the name at the moment).\n\nThe error in question only happens in this one page for this one web site.\n\nUpdate 3\n\nAfter adding the update I realized I was over thinking the problem, I was looking for a more generic solution. However, in this case that isn&#39;t what is needed. \n\nThe page is dynamically generated, however the script tags will stay static. With that in mind the solution becomes much simpler. With that I no longer need to treat it like HTML but as static strings.\n\nSo the solution I&#39;m looking at is\n\n\n\nI would like to avoid Regular Expression however, since I&#39;m limited to only using the standard library regular expressions seems like the best solution in this case.

And there is never a good reason.\nin the worst case  makes your application vulnerable to injection attacks and also it&#39;s very slow. A bit of research reveals plenty of reasons why eval is a big no-no.\nDon&#39;t save your calculation code into the database\nIf you do so and you would like to switch from PHP to another language you would still have PHP code in your database. It makes it really hard to migrate languages. You should always strive to make as many parts of your application as independent as possible.\nIn this case you would tight-couple the language you use, to the database. That&#39;s a bad practice.\nAlso the only possibilities to run your calculations from the database would be to eval them (which is bad, see above) or to disassemble the string with string operations or regex which causes unnecessary effort.\nIt&#39;s all about Strategy\nIn order to solve your problem you must execute code dependent of which calculation you need. That could be either done with switch-case-statements or if-statements. But that&#39;s also not a very elegant solution. Imagine you would need to execute other operations before calculating in the future, or extend functionality. You would need to update all your cases or if-statements.\nThere is a nice design-pattern which is called Strategy Pattern. The strategy pattern solves problems when one use-case can be handled differently which is probably what you want.\nYou want to calculate something (use-case) and there are different calculation types for it (different strategies)\nHow it works\nTo implement the Strategy pattern you basically need three things.\n\nA class where you inject your strategies. It&#39;s basically a wrapper for your strategy tasks.\nAn interface which will be implemented by your strategies\nYour strategies\n\nYour interface could look like this:\n\nThe interface will make sure that all your strategies provide a method to actually run the calculation. Nothing special.\nNext you may want to have a base class that takes your calculation operators as constructor arguments and stores them into properties.\n\nNow it&#39;s getting serious. We are implementing our strategies.\n\nOf course you could clean this one up a bit, but what I want to point out here is the class declaration.\nWe are extending our  class so that we can pass the arithmetic operations via constructor and we are implementing the  which tells our class: &quot;Hey! You must provide a calculate method, I don&#39;t care whether you want or not.\nWe&#39;ll see later why this is an integral part of the pattern.\nSo we have two concrete classes that contain the actual code for the actual arithmetic operation. If you would ever need to, you could change it easily as you see.\nTo add more operations just add another class.\nNow we will create a class where our strategies can be injected. Later you will instantiate an object of this class and work with it.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\nThe most important part here is the constructor. See how we type-hint our interface here. By doing that we make sure that only an object can be injected (Dependency Injection) whose class implements the interface. We do not need to demand a concrete class here. That&#39;s the crucial point here.\nAlso there&#39;s a calculate method in there. It&#39;s just a wrapper for our strategy to execute it&#39;s calculate method.\nWrapping it up\nSo now we just need to create an object of our  class and pass an object of one of our strategy classes (that contain the code for the arithmetic operations).\n\nTry replacing the string stored in  to  and you see that the operation for calculating the percentage will be executed.\nConclusion\nThe strategy pattern allowed you to create a clean interface for working with dynamic tasks that are only made concrete during runtime. Neither your database needs to know how we calculate things, nor your actual calculator does. The only thing we need to make sure is to code against an interface that provides a method to let us calculate things.\n",

All links to your site will still work, and additionally any bookmarks will be updated to your new url path construct.\n\nYou can set it up in Apache using mod_rewrite:\n\n\n\nThis will redirect every url path, which does not start with either , , , ,  to the  (default) sub path.\n\nEdit to comments:\n\nThe solution above would enable for all your links to work (old and new ones).\n\nIf you additionally want to change all the links on your page, so that search engines will see them, then your only option is to rewrite them in your PHP/HTML code (using JavaScript for this is a bad idea for many reasons).\n\nThe best option in this case is to write a helper function, which generates the links for you depending on current language. This way you will have a single point, where you can change your links, should they change once again in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, you won&#39;t be able to change all of your links at once. If you have thousands of them, and no common code which generates all of them, then you have to do this one by one. Good news is, that you are not the first one with this problem, and the developers of professional IDE&#39;s already implement tools to aid you. My personal choice is a commercial software, but other open sourced IDE&#39;s also have a pretty good find/replace options. You can for instance write a regex, which will find your links and replace them accordingly to the rules you provide. To write a good regex replacer might prove to be very beneficial as opposed to reviewing all links one by one.\n\nThis is one of the possible implementation of the url helper:\n\n\n\nNow you have to find all places where links are outputed and use the helper:\n\n\n\nNote that this is just an example of how it could work. I actually don&#39;t recommend to implement the helper as a static method, because static is pure evil. For your real implementation you might consider a helper object instead of helper method.\n",

Below are just a few of them that happened to come to my mind at the moment:\n\n\nWhile current PHP releases may have output buffering on, the actual production servers you will be deploying your code on are far more important than any development or testing machines. And they do not always tend to follow latest PHP trends immediately.\nBy sending headers inadvertently, you might have introduced a security vulnerability: say, you are doing a redirection, but hence the headers are already sent, the redirection does not work and the rest of the page might be output, thus the visitor may see what she was not supposed to see. While this can be mitigated by using exit, you know the story, only if every one of us utilize good programming habits every time.\nEven if letting the visitor stay in the wrong page does not have a security implication, by breaking a session behavior, or in some other ways I&#39;ve encountered over years, the security and/or session cycle might have taken some sort of blow in the end.\nIf not security, you may have headaches over inexplicable functionality loss. Say, you are implementing some kind payment gateway, and redirect user to a specific URL after successful confirmation by the payment processor. If some kind of PHP error, even a warning, or an excess line ending happens, the payment may remain unprocessed and the user may still seem unbilled. This is also one of the reasons why needless redirection is evil and if redirection is to be used, it must be used with caution.\nYou may get &quot;Page loading canceled&quot; type of errors in Internet Explorer, even in the most recent versions. This is because an AJAX response/json include contains something that it shouldn&#39;t contain, because of the excess line endings in some PHP files, just as I&#39;ve encountered a few days ago.\nIf you have some file downloads in your app, they can break too, because of this. And you may not notice it, even after years, since the specific breaking habit of a download depends on the server, the browser, the type and content of the file (and possibly some other factors I don&#39;t want to bore you with).\n\n\nBonus: a few gotchas (actually currently one) related to these 2 characters:\n\n\nEven some well-known libraries may contain excess line endings after ?&gt;. An example is Smarty, even the most recent versions of both 2.* and 3.* branch have this. So, as always, watch for third party code.

That&#39;s not what you intended, but it is the way regexes work. (The &quot;longest left-most rule&quot;.) In theory, it&#39;s still possible to match the regex without killing the stack, but I doubt whether the regex library you&#39;re using is clever enough to make that optimization.\n\nYou can fix the regex to match what you want it to match by making the data part () non-greedy: change it to .

However, we need to parse the regex if we do this.\n\nI can&#39;t speak for the future, but as of Ruby 2.0, there is no better method in the  core class.\n\nA left parenthesis denotes a literal left parenthesis, if preceded by an unescaped backslash. A backslash is unescaped unless an unescaped backslash precedes. So, a character is escaped iff preceded by an odd number of backslashes. \n\nAn unescaped left parenthesis denotes a capturing group iff not followed by a question mark. With a question mark, it can mean various things:  and  denote a named capturing group. Named and unnamed capturing groups cannot coexist in the same regex, however[2].  denote non-capturing groups. This is a special case of .  denote atomic groups. , ,  and  denote lookaround.  denote comments.\n\nRuby regexp engine supports comments in regexes. Considering them in the main regex would be very difficult. We can try to strip them if we really want to support these, but supporting them fully will get messy due to the possibility of inline flags turning extended mode (and thus line comments) on and off in ways that a regular expression cannot capture. I will go ahead and not support unescaped parentheses in regex comments[3].\n\nWe want to count:\n\n\nthe number of left parentheses \nthat are not escaped by a backslash  (read: not preceded by an odd number of backslashes that are not preceded by yet another backslash) and \nthat are not followed by a question mark \n\n\nRuby doesn&#39;t support unbounded lookbehind, but if we reverse the source first, we can rewrite the first assertion slightly: . The second assertion becomes a lookbehind: . \n\nthe whole solution\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: we can show the NP-hardness by converting the satisfiability problem to it:\n\n\nAND:  ( must be an assertion)\nOR: \nNOT: \natoms: , , , ..., , ...\n\n\nexample(XOR): \n\nthis extends to NP-completeness for any class of regexes that can be tested in polynomial time. This includes any regex with no nested repetition (or repeated backreferences to repetition or recursion) and with bounded nesting depth of optional matches.\n\n[2]:  returns , indicating that unnamed capturing groups are ignored when named capturing groups are present. Tested in Ruby 1.9.3\n\n[3]: Inline comments start with  and end with . They cannot contain an unescaped right parenthesis, but they can contain an unescaped left parenthesis. These can be stripped easily (even though we have to sprinkle the &quot;unescaped&quot; regex everywhere), are the lesser evil, but they&#39;re also less likely to contain anunescaped left parenthesis.\n\nLine comments start with  and end with a newline. These are only treated as comments in the extended mode. Outside the extended mode, they match the literal  and newline. This is still easy, even if we have to consider escaping again. Determining if the regex has the extended flag set is not too difficult, but the flag modifier groups are a different beast entirely.\n\nEven with Ruby&#39;s awesome recursive regexes, merely determining if a previously-open group modifying the extended mode is already closed would yield a very nasty regex (even if you replace one by one and don&#39;t have to skip comments, you have to account for escaping).

Anyway here is what I got..\n\n\n\nAre there ANY regexp guru&#39;s out there that could give me some pointers or a regexp that mimics what I need? Which is only getting the deepest stacked instance of a {{tag}} that ends like this {{//tag}}\n\nORIGINAL\n\nOk, so I have an issue I have seen others have, but with a different approach to it.. Or so I thought.. So I am curious if anyone else can help me solve this issue further..\n\nI have a database full of templates that I need to work with in PHP, these templates are made and used by another system, and so there for can not be changed. With that said, these templates have hierarchy style tags added to them. What I need to do, is get these templates from the database, and then programmatically find these tags, their function name (or tag name), and their inner contents, as well as anything following the function (tag) name within the brackets.. An example of one of these tags is, {{FunctionName some (otherStuff) !Here}} Some content sits inside and it ends {{/FunctionName}}\n\nThis is where it gets more fun, the templates have another random tag, which I am guessing are the &quot;variable&quot; style of these tags, as they are always generally the same syntax. Which looks like this, ${RandomTag}, but also there are times that the function style one is there but without an ending tag, like so.. {{RandomLoner}}\n\nExample Template...\n\n\n\nOk so in no way is this a real template, but it follows all the rules that I have seen thus far.\n\nNow I have tried different things with regex and preg_match_all to pull out the matches, and get each of these into a nice array. So far what I have got is this (used it on the example template to make sure its working still)\n\n\n\nI have tried a couple approaches, (that took me nearly 8 hours to get to)\n\n\n\nIn no way am I a guru with regexp, I actually just learned it over the last day or so, trying to get this to work. I have googled for this, and realize that regexp is not designed for nested stuff, but the (?R) seems to do the trick on simple bracket examples Ive seen on the internets, but they always only take into account of the stuff between the { and } or ( and ) or &lt; and &gt;. After reading nearly the whole regex info website, and playing, I came up with these 2 versions.\n\nSo what I NEED to do (I think), would have a regexp work from the DEEPEST hierarchy tag first, and work its way out (if I can do that with help from php, thats fine with me). I was thinking finding the Deepest layer, get its data, and work backwards til all the contents are in 1 fat array. I assumed that was what the ($R) was going to do for me, but it didn&#39;t.\n\nSo any help on what I am missing would be great, also take into note that mine seems to have issues with {{}} that DONT have an ending version of it. So like my {{Random}} example, was removed for the sake of me parsing the array example. I feel these tags, along with the ${} tags can be left alone (if I knew how to do that with regexp), and just remain in the text where they are. I am more or less interested in the functions and getting their data into a multidimensional array for me to work with further.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just have been banging me head all night with this. I started with the assumption that it was going to be a bit easier.. Til I realized the tags where nested :/\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thanks!\n",

            "body": "For what it is worth, most scripting languages (like Perl) and non-static compile-time languages (like Pick) support automatic run-time dynamic String to (relatively arbitrary) object conversions. This CAN be accomplished in Java as well without losing type-safety and the good stuff statically-typed languages provide WITHOUT the nasty side-effects of some of the other languages that do evil things with dynamic casting. A Perl example that does some questionable math:\n\n\n\nIn Java, this is better accomplished (IMHO) by using a method I call &quot;cross-casting&quot;.\nWith cross-casting, reflection is used in a lazy-loaded cache of constructors and methods that are dynamically discovered via the following static method: \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, no built-in Java methods such as Class.cast() will do this for String to BigDecimal or String to Integer or any other conversion where there is no supporting class hierarchy. For my part, the point is to provide a fully dynamic way to achieve this - for which I don&#39;t think the prior reference is the right approach - having to code every conversion. Simply put, the implementation is just to cast-from-string if it is legal/possible.\n\nSo the solution is simple reflection looking for public Members of either:\n\nSTRING_CLASS_ARRAY = (new Class[] {String.class});\n\na) Member member = targetClass.getMethod(method.getName(),STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\nb) Member member = targetClass.getConstructor(STRING_CLASS_ARRAY);\n\nYou will find that all of the primitives (Integer, Long, etc) and all of the basics (BigInteger, BigDecimal, etc) and even java.regex.Pattern are all covered via this approach. I have used this with significant success on production projects where there are a huge amount of arbitrary String value inputs where some more strict checking was needed. In this approach, if there is no method or when the method is invoked an exception is thrown (because it is an illegal value such as a non-numeric input to a BigDecimal or illegal RegEx for a Pattern), that provides the checking specific to the target class inherent logic.\n\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\n1) You need to understand reflection well (this is a little complicated and not for novices).\n2) Some of the Java classes and indeed 3rd-party libraries are (surprise) not coded properly. That is, there are methods that take a single string argument as input and return an instance of the target class but it isn&#39;t what you think... Consider the Integer class:\n\n\n\nThe above method really has nothing to do with Integers as objects wrapping primitives ints.\nReflection will find this as a possible candidate for creating an Integer from a String incorrectly versus the decode, valueof and constructor Members - which are all suitable for most arbitrary String conversions where you really don&#39;t have control over your input data but just want to know if it is possible an Integer.\n\nTo remedy the above, looking for methods that throw Exceptions is a good start because invalid input values that create instances of such objects should throw an Exception. Unfortunately, implementations vary as to whether the Exceptions are declared as checked or not. Integer.valueOf(String) throws a checked NumberFormatException for example, but Pattern.compile() exceptions are not found during reflection lookups. Again, not a failing of this dynamic &quot;cross-casting&quot; approach I think so much as a very non-standard implementation for exception declarations in object creation methods.\n\nIf anyone would like more details on how the above was implemented, let me know but I think this solution is much more flexible/extensible and with less code without losing the good parts of type-safety. Of course it is always best to &quot;know thy data&quot; but as many of us find, we are sometimes only recipients of unmanaged content and have to do the best we can to use it properly.\n\nCheers.\n",

I also realized there&#39;d still be problems with other legitimate matches, such as EVIL: .\n\nSo what it appears I really need is the negation of preceding html entities missing a semicolon:\n\n\n\nBut it is still matching and I&#39;m not sure why.\n\nIt would be ideal to still get returned matches that can be replaced wholesale without further inspection, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.  What is not suitable is first parsing out the html entities, because sometimes they&#39;re necessary and/or part of a legitimate smiley (as with EVIL).\n\n\n\nEDIT (some Google food):\n\nI discovered (and Bryan also noted below) that Zero-width positive lookbehind, , would work as desired (not Zero-width negative lookahead ).\n\nAs per regular-expressions.info, the latter &quot;will only succeed if the regex inside the lookahead fails to match&quot; which sounds right, but isn&#39;t when the section is optional anyway.\n\nIn contrast, the former &quot;matches at a position if the pattern inside the lookahead can be matched ending at that position&quot; which isn&#39;t at all clear, but does the trick.  Because the match is using lookbehind, there&#39;s no chance of backtracking to satisfy the latter portion of the regex.\n\nSo a full regex looks like:\n\n\n\nand that matches these:    while failing this:  \nIt does however still match , so more tweaking would be ideal (such as additionally matching semicolons in place of the ampersands, if that doesn&#39;t cause other smileys with entities in them to break).  People typing out html entities in chat isn&#39;t likely to come up much anyway.\n\nEither way would be &quot;good enough&quot;--except that javascript doesn&#39;t support negative lookbehind.  But it&#39;s worth explaining for the sake of other regex implementations.\n",

It takes any alphabet, whitespace, or hyphen character and turns it into the number . The problem is that it thinks the negative sign in  is &quot;evil text&quot; to turn into a number.\n\nOne way to approach this is to provide an anchor for your regex - Make it match the commas (or beginning/ending of the string) surrounding the text. So it would see  and turn it into  but would see  and know that it&#39;s not text.\n\nAnother approach is to filter based on &quot;does it not contain digits&quot; instead of &quot;does it contain these things I need&quot; - because what if, later, you need to filter out other punctuation marks? Using  would match &quot;things that aren&#39;t digits or commas&quot;, which would turn  into  but keep  the same.\n\nA third approach is to split the string on commas, then test and change each individual segment - probably to see if it contains digits - and then join them back together.\n\nIf you choose the first or second approaches, I leave it up to you to write a regex that either matches a leading comma or the beginning of a string (and a trailing comma or the end of the string - both are similar).

A RegularExpressionValidator can just be dragged and dropped into your ASPX code, and all you&#39;d have to write would be 10-21 characters of regex. With a CustomValidator, you&#39;d have to write custom validation functions, both in the codebehind and the JavaScript.

            "body": "Overview\n\nAround the end of 2009, I wrote a simple templating system for PHP/HTML to be used in-house by our designers for brochure-ware type websites. The goal of the system is to allow templating in otherwise pure HTML via custom tags that are processed by PHP. For example, a templated page might look like this:\n\n\n\nThe template itself might look something like this:\n\n\n\nBesides the Page and Content/Container tags, there are a few other tags included in the core for stuff like flow control, iterating over a collection, outputting dynamic values, etc. The framework is designed so it&#39;s very easy to add your own set of tags registered under another prefix and namespace.\n\nCustom Tags to PHP\n\nHow do we parse these custom tags? Since the&#39;re no guarantee that the HTML file is well-formed XML, solutions like XSLT/XPATH won&#39;t be reliable. Instead, we use a regex to look for tags with registered prefixes, and replace those with PHP code. The PHP code is a stack-based design... upon encountering an opening tag, an object representing the tag is created pushed onto the stack, and its &quot;initialization function&quot; (if any) runs. Whenever a registered closing tag is encountered, the most recent object is popped off the stack, and its &quot;rendering function&quot; runs.\n\nSo, after the framework replaces the templating tags with PHP, our example page might look something like this (in realty it&#39;s a bit uglier):\n\n\n\nThe good, the bad, and \n\nNow, how to execute our newly-generated PHP code? I can think of a few options here. The easiest is to simply  the string, and that works well enough. However, any programmer will tell you &quot;eval is evil, don&#39;t use it...&quot; so the question is, is there anything more appropriate than  that we can use here? \n\nI&#39;ve considered using a temporary or cached file, using  output streams, etc, but as far as I can see these don&#39;t offer any real advantage over . Caching could speed things up, but in practice all the sites we have on this thing are already blazingly fast, so I see no need to make speed optimizations at this point.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor each of the things on this list: is it a good idea? Can you think of a better alternative?\n\n\nthe whole idea in general (custom tags for html / php)\nconverting tags to php code instead of processing directly\nthe stack-based approach \nthe use of  (or similar)\n\n\nThanks for reading and TIA for any advice. :)\n",

This lets you iterate over each individual character, which more clearly indicates your intent, is less prone to bugs as you know you&#39;re treating each character at once, and is more efficient*.  Likewise your valid character sets should also be characters.\n\nYour logic is pretty strangely expressed; you&#39;re not even referencing the specialChars set at all, and the looping logic once you&#39;ve found a match seems odd.  I think this is your bug; the matching seems to be the wrong way round in that if the character matches the first valid char, you set flag to  and continue round the current loop; so it will definitely not match the next valid char and hence you break out of the loop with a  flag.  Always.\n\nI would have thought something like this would be more intuitive:\n\n\n\nThis doesn&#39;t take sequences into account (e.g. the strings &quot;--------**  &quot; and &quot;1&quot; would be valid because all individual characters are valid) but then neither does your original code.

You could name each entry in the file and load them all into a hash table for easy access from your code.\n\nSecond choice, create a file that will be pre-processed into a java interface; it could escape the regex as it does so.  Personally I hate code generation, but if the java file is 100% never human edited, it&#39;s not too bad (the real evil is generated files that you are expected to edit!)\n\nThird (tricky and probably a bad idea): You might be able to create a custom doclet that will extract strings from your comments into a text file or a header file at compile time, then use one of the other two methods above.  This keeps your strings in the same file in which they are being used.  This could be really hard to do correctly, and the penalties of failure are extreme, so I wouldn&#39;t even consider it unless I had an overwhelming need and some pretty impressive talent.\n\nI only suggest this because comments are free-form and things within a &quot;pre&quot; tag are pretty safe from formatters and other system uglies.  The doclet could extract this before printing the javadocs, and could even add some of the generated javadocs indicating your use of regex strings.\n\nBefore downvoting and telling me this is a stupid idea--I KNOW, I just thought I&#39;d suggest it because it&#39;s interesting, but my preference as I stated above is a simple text file...\n",

I do not see a problem with performing a different type of validation in the UI layer, Business logic layer and lastly the Database itself.\n\nIn my mind, the ideal scenario would be one where the UI layer validates user submitted data for possible malicious input, illegal values, Regex pattern matches and required fields. The second layer would validate the type of data and whether it meshes together to form concrete updatable objects that can be propagated to the data store. The database would impose basic constraints such as the one you mentioned for all operations.\n\nAlso, the level of validation required would decrease with each level... starting from rigorous in the UI layer to basic in the database layer.\n\nI believe in one rule - &quot;All input is evil until proven otherwise.&quot; \n",
