This expression is an attempt to match the most obvious features of a valid date in American/US format of the form mm/dd/yyyy for any year 1900 through 2003. It matches any date where the day part is any number 01-31, the month part is any number 01-12, and the year part is any number 1900-2003. The only invalid dates that it matches are ones where the day part may be in the range 01-31 but that range might not be valid for the specified month.

(Regex for "12-hour" with AM/PM) [0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{3}[ AM|PM]
Match examples start with "1" followed by "AM" or "PM". Non-match examples start with "13" followed by either "PM" or "AM".
You could use the regex:
[a-f0-9]{1}[a-f0-9]- The regex is [a-f]?[0-9a-f]?[0-9]?[0-9]?- The regex will match the following characters:
^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}$Use the re.match() function to find the first non-match example.
\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{2}
#\d{3}[a-f]{3}
^#[A-Fa-f0-9]{6}$
To match a hashtag (#) followed by a four-digit number, you could use the pattern "#[0-9]{4}". The square brackets [] in the pattern indicate a range of values that can be matched. The "{" and "}" are special characters that indicate the start and end of
_[\u0065-\u0084][\u0087-\u0089][\u0095-\u0096][\u0099-\u00A9][\u00AB-\u00B9][\u00C3-\u

\d{1,2}/[A-Za-z]{3}[-\s]\d{4}
[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{4}
A regex for this should look like:"^(0-2)([0-9][0-9]|3[0-1])/([0-9][0-9]|3[0-1])/
[0-9]{2}[-][0-9]{2}[-][0-9]{4}Using a pattern with this regex, we can match any date in the format "dd/mm

This is a very hard question, but here is a possible answer:
The regular expression for a date is D/M/Y format in dd/mm/yyyy.
regex = "[0-9]{2}\/[0-9]{2}\/[0-9]{4}"
To match dates in dd/mm/yyyy format, we use the following regular expression: "^[0-9]+/[0-9]+/[0-9]+$".
[^/\d/]*[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{4}.*
[^0-9/]*?
dd/mm/yyyy, where / is the delimiter.

^(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$
To generate a RegEx for this description, you need to include the IP address range, the netmask, and the subnet mask separately. The IP address range is separated by a "." and the netmask
^(0|[1-9]\d?\d?)\.(0|[1-9]\d?\d?)\.(0|[1-9]\d?\d?)
The network range should consist of two numbers separated by a dot, where each number is separated by a slash (ie., [0-9]{1,

[^0-9]2. Generate a RegEx for the following description. A person's name has to start with a letter, follow by a space, and end with a 5-digit number. The number is supposed to be between 100-999.Answer: [A-Z][a-z][0-9]{5

This is a bit more challenging, as it requires the use of two letters. I would recommend using the character class [A-Z] to represent the range of letters and then using the character set [a-z] to represent the specific letter "a". This should create a RegEx
^([A-Za-z])$

(?i)([A-Z]|[a-z])(?=[A-Z]|[a-z])
The RegEx for the description "B-L" is "B(?=L)|L(?=B)"The string must have exactly one letter in the range A-Z or a-z.

Match "ing" when it appears at the end of a word.
(\w+ing\w+)
(.+)(ing)\b(?=(\w+th\s\w+e\s\w+ing))

The correct pattern is "hi" followed by one or more consonants, followed by one or more vowels. However, since "hi" is itself a consonant, the correct pattern is "hi". Generate a RegEx for this description.
(Any valid RegEx) "ing$"
import re

The regular expression is /^[a-z]+ing$/.
