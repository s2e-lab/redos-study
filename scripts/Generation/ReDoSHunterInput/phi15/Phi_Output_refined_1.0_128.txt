Accurate Canadian postal code format verification.The format of a Canadian postal code is LDL DLD where L are alpha characters and D are numeric digits. But there are some exceptions. The letters D, F, I, O, Q and U never appear in a postal code because of their visual similarity to 0, E, 1, 0, 0, and V respectively. In addition to avoiding the six &quot;forbidden&quot; letters W and Z also do not appear as the first letter of a postal code (at least not at present).Match examples:- "M1R 4B2

This will validate a partial postcode beginning with the postal district on up to the whole postcode, returning the two halves in sub-expressions. The main purpose is to return a valid postal district from a partial or whole postcode. The real value in this regex lies in the fact that it will process the postcode correctly regardless of whether or not the space in present after the district. So the accepted formats are A1 1AA, A11 1AA, A1A 1AA, AA1 1AA, AA11 1AA, AA1A 1AA GIR 0AA (and the same 6 formats without the space to

This expression is an attempt to match the most obvious features of a valid date in American/US format of the form mm/dd/yyyy for any year 1900 through 2003. It matches any date where the day part is any number 01-31, the month part is any number 01-12, and the year part is any number 1900-2003. The only invalid dates that it matches are ones where the day part may be in the range 01-31 but that range might not be valid for the specified month. An example of an invalid date that it would allow to pass through would be 11/31/2002. This date is

This will validate a partial postcode beginning with the postal district on up to the whole postcode, returning the two halves in sub-expressions. The main purpose is to return a valid postal district from a partial or whole postcode. The real value in this regex lies in the fact that it will process the postcode correctly regardless of whether or not the space in present after the district. So the accepted formats are A1 1AA, A11 1AA, A1A 1AA, AA1 1AA, AA11 1AA, AA1A 1AA GIR 0AA (and the same 6 formats without the space in

This will validate a partial postcode beginning with the postal district on up to the whole postcode, returning the two halves in sub-expressions. The main purpose is to return a valid postal district from a partial or whole postcode. The real value in this regex lies in the fact that it will process the postcode correctly regardless of whether or not the space in present after the district. So the accepted formats are A1 1AA, A11 1AA, A1A 1AA, AA1 1AA, AA11 1AA, AA1A 1AA GIR 0AA (and the same 6 formats without the space before

Accurate Canadian postal code format verification.The format of a Canadian postal code is LDL DLD where L are alpha characters and D are numeric digits. But there are some exceptions. The letters D, F, I, O, Q and U never appear in a postal code because of their visual similarity to 0, E, 1, 0, 0, and V respectively. In addition to avoiding the six &quot;forbidden&quot; letters W and Z also do not appear as the first letter of a postal code (at least not at present).Match examples:- "M1R 4B9

This will validate a partial postcode beginning with the postal district on up to the whole postcode, returning the two halves in sub-expressions. The main purpose is to return a valid postal district from a partial or whole postcode. The real value in this regex lies in the fact that it will process the postcode correctly regardless of whether or not the space in present after the district. So the accepted formats are A1 1AA, A11 1AA, A1A 1AA, AA1 1AA, AA11 1AA, AA1A 1AA GIR 0AA (and the same 6 formats without the space after

This will validate a partial postcode beginning with the postal district on up to the whole postcode, returning the two halves in sub-expressions. The main purpose is to return a valid postal district from a partial or whole postcode. The real value in this regex lies in the fact that it will process the postcode correctly regardless of whether or not the space in present after the district. So the accepted formats are A1 1AA, A11 1AA, A1A 1AA, AA1 1AA, AA11 1AA, AA1A 1AA GIR 0AA (and the same 6 formats without the space).

Accurate Canadian postal code format verification.The format of a Canadian postal code is LDL DLD where L are alpha characters and D are numeric digits. But there are some exceptions. The letters D, F, I, O, Q and U never appear in a postal code because of their visual similarity to 0, E, 1, 0, 0, and V respectively. In addition to avoiding the six &quot;forbidden&quot; letters W and Z also do not appear as the first letter of a postal code (at least not at present).Match examples:- "M1R 4B8
