This pattern allows standard e-mail addresses (e.g. user@domain.com), sub domains (e.g. user@foo.domain.com), the new two- and four-letter domains (e.g. user@domain.tv and user@domain.name) and country codes (e.g. user@foo.com.us). Also, this patter follows the Network Solutions standard length of 67 characters for top-level domains. The reason I allow numbers to be entered in the domain suffix is for future planning.

This is a pattern to search and verify that a decimal number ends with a 25, 50, 75, 0 or 00. It does match for a nothing after decimal also but I guess thats ok!!Generate a RegEx for this description. Answer:^(25|50|75|0|00)$

This expression is an attempt to match the most obvious features of a valid date in American/US format of the form mm/dd/yyyy for any year 1900 through 2003. It can easily be adapted for different date ranges. It matches any date where the day part is any number 01-31, the month part is any number 01-12, and the year part is any number 1900-2003. The only invalid dates that it matches are ones where the day part may be in the range 01-31 but that range might not be valid for the specified month. An example of an invalid date that it would allow to pass through is

Expression to handle US currency entry in.NET. Handy for regular expression validation controls where the user can be entering in a currancy value but you can't control explict entry values. Will accept a wide variety of values that can be easy cast to a double via the CDbl function. Expression is also compatible with default US string format for currency.Generate a RegEx for this description. Answer:    public static string CurrencyExpression(string currency)    {        string currencyExpression = "^[0-9]{1,3}(,?[0-9]

Email address validator. Should cover most of RFC 822, including unusual (but still valid) addresses. Does not restrict the top level domain size, but you're better off doing an nslookup or similar if you absolutely must have a valid domain. Accepts IP Addresses instead of the domain, with or without brackets. Believe it or not, this one is valid:!#$%^&amp;amp;amp;amp;*-+~/'`|{}@xyz.comSorry looks like this site is mangling the quote and ampersand characters - you'll have to fix that yourself.

Regular expression for US (ZIP and ZIP+4) and Canadian postal codes. It allows 5 digits for the first US postal code and requires that the +4, if it exists, is four digits long. Canadain postal codes can contain a space and take form of A1A 1A1. The letters can be upper or lower case, but the first letter must be one of the standard Canadian zones: A,B,C,E,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,R,S,T,V,X,Y.Generate a RegEx for this description.

Validates *usable* US telephone numbers (possibly Canadian and Caribbean Islands as well?) Numbers cannot beginning with zero, one, (any number)11, or 555. It will allow either a hyphen, space or period as a separator.Technically (and contrary to popular belief) most 555- numbers ARE valid numbers [see http://www.nanpa.com/nas/public/form555MasterReport.do?method=display555MasterReport ] but they are unlikely to be used by normal folks. Therefore, excluding them with this regex is useful to prevent bogus/fraudulent telephone numbers in forms.

This will validate a partial postcode beginning with the postal district on up to the whole postcode, returning the two halves in sub-expressions. The main purpose is to return a valid postal district from a partial or whole postcode. The real value in this regex lies in the fact that it will process the postcode correctly regardless of whether or not the space in present after the district. So the accepted formats are A1 1AA, A11 1AA, A1A 1AA, AA1 1AA, AA11 1AA, AA1A 1AA GIR 0AA (and the same 6 formats without the space).

This regular expression is intended to limit numeric entries by allowed places before and after the decimal point. It also recognizes whole numbers. In this example the value cannot exceed 99999.999. To change the range, simply edit the numbers in curly braces. For example, to allow 7 digits (millions) before the decimal point, change both instances of {0,5} to {0,7}. Likewise, to change the decimals from allowing thousandths (3 digits) to just hundreths, change the {0,3} to {0,2}. This can be useful for numeric fields in SQL. This example

This expression will allow whole dollar amounts (along with $ and,) which are 20 digit wide. So the maximum amount will be $99,999,999,999,999,999,999. Note: This regular expression allows skipped commas, but will not allow multiple or commas at the wrong location. This can be used for all languages that have comma before the 3rd, 6th, 9th... digit.Generate a RegEx for this description. Answer: (?<!\d)(?<!\d,)(?<!\d,)(?<!\d,)(
