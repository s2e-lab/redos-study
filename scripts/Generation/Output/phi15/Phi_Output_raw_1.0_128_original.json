We discussed the basic format and syntax of regular expressions and introduced the re and re.findall modules to match, search for, and extract patterns. Finally, we gave an example of using regular expressions to find and replace scientific notation in a file. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for data processing and should be mastered"
