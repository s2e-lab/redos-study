# ReDoS Comprehension from LLM and Developers' Discussions
This repository contains the source code of the paper "Understanding Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS): Insights from LLM-Generated Regexes and Developer Forums", conditionally accepted at the  32nd International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2024).

## Abstract
Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) represents an algorithmic complexity attack that exploits the processing of regular
expressions (regexes) to produce a denial-of-service attack. This
attack manifests when regex evaluation time scales polynomially
or exponentially with input length, posing sporadic yet significant
challenges for software developers. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the generation of regexes from
natural language prompts, but not without its risks. Prior works
showed that LLMs can generate code with vulnerabilities and security smells. In this paper, we synthesized a vast collection of regex
patterns from a comprehensive dataset, assessing their correct-
ness and ReDoS vulnerability. We investigated the characteristics
of these vulnerable regexes, categorizing them into equivalence
classes to unravel their weaknesses. Our inquiry also extended to
examining ReDoS patterns in actual software projects, aligning
them with corresponding regex classes. LLM-generated regexes
mainly have polynomial ReDoS vulnerability patterns, and it is
consistent with the real-world data. Moreover, we analyzed de-
veloper dialogues on GitHub and StackOverflow, constructing a
taxonomy to investigate their experiences and perspectives on Re-
DoS. In this study, we found that GPT-3.5 was the best LLM to
generate regexes that are both correct and secure. We also found
that developersâ€™ main concern is related to mitigation strategies to
remove vulnerable regexes.

## Usage
### Installation

Run the following command to install the required packages:
```
conda create -n "redos_study"  python=3.9.4
conda activate redos_study
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install accelerate
```

### Generation
There are three Python files for three models: gpt35.py, Phi_RegexGen and T5_Regexgen.py. You can run them to generate the regexes.



You will need an OpenAI API key for gpt35.py and have to create a **config.json** file as the **example.json** file. Update your API key in the **config.json** file.

*fix_gpt35.ipynb* will try to regenerate the regexes generated by GPT-3.5 if there is an error.

*gpt35_filter.ipynb* will filter additional text generated by GPT-3.5. 

*phi_filter.ipynb* will filter additional text generated by Phi model.

*ReDoSHunter_Input_Creation.ipynb* will create the input for [ReDoSHunter](https://github.com/yetingli/ReDoSHunter). Check the corresponding link about running it.

### Evaluation
**Compilation.ipynb** will compile the Regexes and tests with the corresponding tests. It will generate {Model_name}_{Prompt_type}_Output_Compiled_Result.json. Then, you can run **Pass_at_k_Evaluation.ipynb** to get the pass@k score.

**DFA_Equ_Evaluation.ipynb** will use *regex_dfa_equals.jar* to find out the DFA match and calculate the DFA-EQ@k score.


**EM_Evaluation.ipynb** will calculate the Exact match ratio.

### Other files
- Files with the name *[gG]ithub* or *stackoverflow|SO* are used to collect the data from GitHub and StackOverflow.
